<h2 id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</h2>

<p>In this work an attempt has been made to give in
outline the best modern methods of attack upon a fortified
position by assault, surprise, blockade, or siege;
and also the detailed constructions of those types of
trenches, batteries, magazines, etc., etc., which seem best
suited to resist the fire of modern cannon, and to afford
cover to a besieging force.</p>

<p>It is not supposed that these types will be exactly
copied in all cases of actual practice, but that a wise
discretion will be used in modifying or combining them
when necessary or desirable.</p>

<p>The constructions given are standard types, which
have grown up by combining the suggestions and the
experience of the military engineers of all civilized
nations.</p>

<p>In selecting them I have drawn freely upon the textbooks
of the schools of military engineering at Chatham,
Fontainebleau, Vienna, and Berlin, as well as upon that
of the late Professor Mahan, and the manuals of Duane
and Ernst.</p>

<p>The standard work of Gumpertz and Lebrun is frequently
referred to in “Military Mining”; and I am
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_iv">iv</span>
also under obligations to General H. L. Abbot, Corps of
Engineers, for the use of his unpublished notes on the
experimental mines at Willett’s Point, and the result
of his experiments upon the mining effects of shells
charged with different explosives.</p>

<h2 id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<p>Modern wars have been marked by sharp aggressive
campaigns and great battles in the open field, with few
close and long-continued sieges.</p>

<p>The subject of siege-works has therefore attracted
less popular attention than was formerly devoted to it.</p>

<p>Fort Wagner, Vicksburg, Petersburg, Strasburg, Belfort,
Paris, Plevna, and Géok Tépé have shown, however,
that at their respective dates regular siege and
mining operations were necessary to reduce either permanent
or field fortifications, if well equipped and defended.</p>

<p>The volume of fire delivered by the small arms and
machine guns now in use has made an open assault
upon a well-supplied and well-defended parapet, under
ordinary circumstances, a hopeless undertaking, and
has necessitated more deliberate methods of attack.</p>

<p>The increased accuracy and penetration of modern
cannon have rendered obsolete many of the older
methods of making regular approaches.</p>

<p>The newer constructions described herein, while giving
greater protection to the attack, are in general
slower in their advance than those previously used.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">vi</span>
This seems, however, to be an unavoidable evil, which
is mitigated only by taking advantage of every opportunity
for rapid advance offered by the errors of the
defence.</p>

<p>It is not to be inferred that light field works and
lines will in the general case require for their attack a
system of regular approaches; but trenches and saps
may be necessary for placing a battery or parapet in a
commanding position or one favorable for enfilade, or
for giving a covered approach over an exposed ridge;
and their frequent employment may be expected on
future fields.</p>

<p>The destructive effect of grenades and Coehorn shells
charged with high explosives will doubtless in many
cases check or stop the advance of saps and trenches,
and necessitate the use of blinded approaches or mining-galleries
in stubbornly contested sieges. The successful
application of mines at Géok Tépé will doubtless
lead to their future employment under similar
circumstances. In the close attack upon a shielded
casemate or disappearing turret their use seems a necessity,
and when these defences are founded on rock
or massive concrete foundations, tunnelling operations
by drilling and blasting will be required. When practicable
they will be expedited by the use of power-drills
driven by electricity.</p>

<p>It seems hardly necessary to add, that in sapping and
mining operations, as in all other branches of military
engineering, all new and improved inventions and
methods which are applicable to the work on hand will
be used, as a matter of course.</p>

<p>The thickness of cover given in the text is based
upon the penetrations of the hostile projectiles.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vii">vii</span></p>

<p>For ready reference the maximum penetrations obtained
in experimental firing up to this date (1894) are
given herewith, viz.:</p>

<p>Service bullets, copper or German-silver jacket, of
6.5 to 8 mm. calibre, initial velocity from 2000 to 2550
f. s.:</p>

<p>French authorities give a muzzle penetration of
12 mm. = 0´´.473 in iron plates for the Lebel bullet.
No published experiments confirm this.</p>

the penetration of the projectile of field and
siege guns into earth, and the published data are very
meagre and unsatisfactory.</p>

<p>English authorities report craters of 21 feet length
and 8 feet depth blown out from an earth parapet by a
single 200-lb. 8-in. howitzer shell. They also state that
the projectile of the pneumatic dynamite gun has penetrated
40 feet of earth.</p>

<p>Owing to the rapid development of ordnance the
current scientific and military periodicals are in general
the only source from which the latest results in penetration,
etc., can be obtained.

<span class="large">THE ATTACK WITHOUT THE USE OF REGULAR
APPROACHES.</span></h2>

<p id="I_art1"><b>1.</b> A fortified position may be taken by <i>blockade</i>,
<i>surprise</i>, <i>assault</i>, <i>bombardment</i>, or <i>siege</i>.</p>

<p>A <b>blockade</b> consists in so surrounding a place and
closing its communications as to keep the garrison from
receiving reinforcements, provisions, and supplies sufficient
to enable it to continue the defence and to avoid
starvation.</p>

<p>The object of the attacking force is, in general, to
completely close all communications between the garrison
and the exterior; but this is not always possible,
nor is it necessary in all cases, since such obstruction
of communications as will reduce the incoming supplies
below the necessary expenditures of the garrison will
ultimately exhaust its stores.</p>

<p>An efficient blockade, continued long enough, will
consequently reduce any place.</p>

<p>Whether it is advisable to attempt to reduce a place
by blockade will depend upon the time which will
probably be taken in its reduction, the force required
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>
for surrounding it, and repelling sorties from the interior
or beating back a relieving army, and the expense
in men and materials of taking the work by other
methods. Blockades are more effective in reducing
cities and towns than in taking places occupied only by
a military garrison, since the presence of a large number
of non-combatants in a place rapidly exhausts its
store of provisions, renders epidemics more likely to
break out, and by the suffering and misery resulting
demoralizes the garrison, unnerves the commander, and
eventually causes its fall. This justifies the apparent
harshness of not allowing non-combatants to leave a beleaguered
place.</p>

<p>The steps necessary for establishing the blockade are
identical with those taken for the investment in a regular
siege and will be described hereafter.</p>

<p>The capture of Paris in 1870-71 is one of the most
recent and striking examples of a blockade on a large
scale.</p>

<h3 id="Surprise">SURPRISE.</h3>

<p id="I_art2"><b>2.</b> A sudden and unexpected attack made upon a
garrison unprepared to receive it is called a <b>surprise</b>.</p>

<p>Formerly these were of not infrequent occurrence,
but with modern means of communication and methods
of warfare they can hardly be looked for, except
in small affairs, where, through the weakness or exhaustion
of a garrison or the incapacity of its commander,
the necessary and ordinary precautions for
their prevention are impracticable or are neglected;
or where they are brought about through treachery
in the garrison, by which the gates are opened to the
attack.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span></p>

<p>Probably in the majority of cases attempts at surprise
will be detected and defeated; but as a success is
usually valuable far in excess of the losses suffered in
its execution, promising opportunities for their trial
should not be neglected.</p>

<p>Surprises, when thought possible, are undertaken
under the cover of night, fog, or severe storms. The
tactical disposition of the troops is similar to that used
in open assault, the columns being preceded by ladder-parties
for scaling walls, engineers for blowing down
barriers, etc., etc., according to the nature of the case,
and followed by a large reserve which is designed to
hold any points captured by the advancing columns.
It is usually considered best to make simultaneous attacks
at several points, in order to confuse and divide
the defence, holding the main reserve nearest to the
column which is expected to succeed; but making provision
also for promptly and fully supporting any other
party which may have forced an entrance into the
work. An entrance secured, consecutive points should
be occupied and held, preserving communication between
them, and avoiding too great dispersion of the
troops, until a foothold is gained which can in all probability
be held against the defence. After this greater
boldness may be used in attacking important points
within the place.</p>

<p>The complete capture of the work and its garrison
cannot ordinarily be expected, however, until daylight
allows the systematic movement of the attack
throughout the place. In case of failure, any captured
gate must be held if possible until all the
troops have retreated through it and are covered by
the reserves.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span></p>

<h3 id="Defence_against_Surprise">DEFENCE AGAINST SURPRISE.</h3>

<p id="I_art3"><b>3.</b> The measures necessary to guard a fortified place
against surprise are of two classes. First, for its prevention,
by use of all the usual outposts and interior
guards,&mdash;the organization and duties of which need not
be repeated here,&mdash;and of telegraphic and other signals
and communications with the surrounding country by
which the approach and movements of any attacking
force may be made known before it comes near the
work.</p>

<p>Second, for its repulse, by so training and disciplining
the garrison that, upon the alarm being given,
the parapets, batteries, etc., will be manned and all defensive
measures will be taken before the assaulting
body can enter the work.</p>

<p>This will be accomplished by so thoroughly drilling
the garrison in its duties that each man will go at once
to his proper station fully equipped for his duties at
any hour day or night, without confusion or unnecessary
excitement. The subsequent measures are the
same as for resisting any other assault.</p>

<h3 id="Assault">ASSAULT.</h3>

<p id="I_art4"><b>4.</b> By an <b>assault</b> is meant an open attack upon a
position by troops in line or column.</p>

<p>Formerly it was recommended to make assaults at
early dawn, in order to have the increasing daylight for
securing the results of victory; more recently night attacks
have been more strongly advocated in order to
diminish the losses from the fire of the defence while
making the attack, and the still greater ones which follow
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
a repulse when, the fire of the supports and reserves
of the attack being suspended for fear of injuring
the retreating troops, the defence pours upon the latter
the full close and deadly fire of all its arms. Whether
the advantages of a night attack more than counterbalance
the dangers resulting from the confusion due
to darkness is, however, a question not yet settled.</p>

<p>Open assaults upon fortified positions, well manned
and armed, have, since the introduction of firearms,
been considered the most bloody, uncertain, and frequently
the most unjustifiable operations in war. With
the introduction of machine and rapid-fire guns and
magazine rifles it may be considered as an established
fact that a well-defended line cannot be carried by an
assault in front until its fire is overpowered or its ammunition
exhausted.</p>

<p>This conclusion, which has been drawn from attacks
on field-works, is still more positive in regard to attack
upon works of strong profile protected by deep ditches
and other obstacles.</p>

<h3 id="Dispositions_for_an_Assault">DISPOSITIONS FOR AN ASSAULT.</h3>

<p id="I_art5"><b>5.</b> When an assault is ordered the tactical dispositions
must be so made as to keep the fire of the defence
down to its lowest possible limit, until the assailant
can close in with the bayonet.</p>

<p>With this end in view, batteries are established
sweeping the lines; the assaulting columns, well supplied
with ammunition, are formed where protected
from fire; working parties are arranged and provided
with such tools and appliances as are necessary for
removing or overcoming obstacles; and all preparations
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
are made for simultaneous action by the entire
force.</p>

<p>It is manifest that to silence the fire of the work the
attack must have a marked preponderance of artillery
arranged both for enfilade and front fire upon the front
of attack and the collateral works; and that the batteries
must be established, the fire opened, and the
guns of the defence silenced before the assault is made;
and that this fire must continue until the assaulting
troops are so near the work as to necessitate its discontinuance
to avoid injury to them.</p>

<p>The working parties&mdash;carrying axes, saws, crowbars,
and similar tools which are needed for removing the
existing obstacles; explosives for blowing down gates,
barriers, etc.; fascines, gabions, hurdles, etc., for crossing
ditches, covering trous de loup, and other purposes;
and, when necessary, ladders for escalade&mdash;move forward
with the columns of attack; the latter must be so
handled that, when the artillery fire is suspended, they
can keep down the fire of the defence with rifle and light
machine-gun fire.</p>

<p>Under cover of this fire the obstacles must be removed
by the working parties, and the first assault
made by the troops detailed for this purpose. With
these troops should be a certain number of artillerists
provided with lanyards, friction primers, etc., to serve
any guns that may be captured, turning them against
the defence.</p>

<p>A party of engineers provided with high explosives
for blowing down gates, etc., should follow closely behind
the advance in case of an escalade; they should
also be provided with appliances for blowing up magazines,
etc., when possible, in case of a repulse. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
gates being captured and opened, the mass of the assaulting
troops enter by them and complete the capture
of the place.</p>

<p>In case of repulse the retreat of the advanced parties
is covered, when possible, by the infantry fire of
the reserves, and that of the latter by the artillery, as in
the advance.</p>

<h3 id="Defence_against_an_Assault">DEFENCE AGAINST AN ASSAULT.</h3>

<p id="I_art6"><b>6.</b> Permanent works being designed to be secure
against assaults and surprise, their guns of position
are protected as well as circumstances admit against
the hostile artillery and infantry fire. During the cannonade
preliminary to an assault a wise discretion must
be used as to how much ammunition may be profitably
expended in replying to it, and how great an exposure
of the men to the artillery fire is justifiable. As a rule
but little reply is made from the work.</p>

<p>The machine and rapid-fire guns should be withdrawn
from the parapets and be protected under bomb-proofs
until the relaxation of the hostile fire due to the
near approach of the assault allows them to be run out
and to open fire. The infantry of the garrison is similarly
handled, being held under cover until the proper
moment, then manning the parapet and pouring a close,
rapid, and deadly fire upon the assault.</p>

<p>The fire of the fronts directly attacked, both machine-gun
and infantry, will be directed principally at the assaulting
columns and working parties, the collateral
works and fronts will, in addition to pouring a cross-fire
upon the assaulting columns, direct a large part of
their machine-gun fire upon the supports and reserves,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
while the more powerful guns will generally direct
their fire upon the hostile artillery.</p>

<p>The troops not needed for manning the parapets are
held under cover in a central position as a reserve, to
strengthen the force at any part of the parapet or to
meet and drive out any body of the enemy penetrating
the work.</p>

<p>Should the attack be repulsed, the most rapid and
destructive fire from all arms is directed upon the retreating
troops with a view to inflicting the greatest
possible losses; but a counter-attack is, as a rule, not
attempted. When made, however, it should be limited
to making an advance upon one or both flanks to a
position giving a more effective fire upon the retreating
troops, and retiring from this position to the cover
of the work as soon as the main attack is completely
repulsed and before the advanced troops become compromised
by a close engagement with the enemy.</p>

<h3 id="Bombardment">BOMBARDMENT.</h3>

<p id="I_art7"><b>7.</b> By a <b>bombardment</b>, technically speaking, is
meant a more or less continuous shell-fire upon a place
with a view to destroying magazines, buildings, materials,
and supplies of all kinds, in addition to inflicting
the greatest possible losses upon the garrison and producing
among the inhabitants a state of terror and unrest,
frequently extending to mutiny, and finally causing
the surrender of the place.</p>

<p>The term bombardment is also frequently applied to
a cannonade opened upon a place to silence its artillery
prior to an assault or during a siege.</p>

<p>A bombardment promises success when the place is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
small and not well provided with bomb-proofs, when
the garrison is weak or of bad morale, when the inhabitants
are numerous and not in sympathy with the garrison,
or when the commandant is weak. A well-built
and well-equipped modern fort can hardly be reduced
by bombardment with any reasonable expenditure of
time and ammunition; although the successful use of
torpedo-shells charged with high explosives will probably
render untenable works not designed to resist their
effects.</p>

<p>When it is designed to reduce a place by bombardment
a complete investment is, as a rule, necessary only
to prevent the withdrawal of the non-combatants (a
severe measure, but one frequently adopted), or to insure
the capture of the garrison upon the fall of the place.</p>

<p>The disposition of the troops is made for the special
object in view. The infantry, cavalry, and field artillery
complete the investment, if made; or, when the
place is not invested, are concentrated at such points
as may be necessary to protect the artillery from any
sorties from the place, and to meet and repel attacks
from any relieving force.</p>

<p>The artillery of larger calibre used for the bombardment
proper should consist principally of rifled howitzers
and mortars, which are easier to transport and
more suitable for high-angle fire. As it is not intended
to dismount or silence the guns of the place by direct
or enfilade fire, an artillery duel should be avoided.</p>

<p>The batteries should be located, so far as possible,
in places screened from the artillery of the defence by
undulations of the ground, etc.; or, if this is impossible,
by artificial screens as a cover from sight, and by
trenches as a protection from fire.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span></p>

<p>Considerable latitude is allowed in selecting sites for
batteries. For convenience of supply and unity of
command they should be collected in groups, the batteries
of the groups separated by at least 100 to 200
yards; and the groups should be located, so far as
other considerations allow, near the main lines of
communication.</p>

<p>If these groups do not entirely surround the place,
they should, when practicable, extend at least half way
around, so as to bring a reverse fire on all covers.</p>

<p>The fire, once opened, should continue night and day.
If a conflagration breaks out, a sharp fire of shells
should be directed upon it and its vicinity to prevent
its extinction. Special efforts should be made to blow up
magazines and destroy shops, storehouses, docks, roads,
bridges, or other communications useful to the defence;
but, so far as is practicable consistently with these, an
attempt should be made to avoid injury to public
monuments, museums, antiquities, and works of art.</p>

<p>Bombardments are sometimes commenced and continued
for a longer or shorter time without the expectation
of reducing the place, but to destroy some of
the constructions above mentioned or to prevent the
completion or arming of a work which it is intended
to attack by other methods. A slow bombardment
may also precede the active cannonade which prepares
for an assault, or the systematic artillery attack of a
regular siege.</p>

<h3 id="Defence_against_a_Bombardment">DEFENCE AGAINST BOMBARDMENT.</h3>

<p id="I_art8"><b>8.</b> The defence against bombardment is frequently,
from necessity, strictly passive, and consists in so disposing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
the troops and materials as to protect them
under bomb- and splinter-proofs, repairing damages to
the latter and to magazines and parapets as occasion
offers; saving the ammunition of the place by firing
only such shots as promise to pay for themselves by
the effect produced; and reserving all the strength of
the place to meet the subsequent attack, if made.</p>

<p>When circumstances admit, a more active defence
may be made, by a strong garrison, by well-conducted
sorties which may capture and destroy the hostile
guns and batteries and defeat and drive off their
supports.</p>

<p>Sorties of this kind may sometimes be profitably
made against the flanks of the attacking force, or
against isolated batteries, even when a general attack
cannot be made. Opportunities for their use should
not be neglected.

<br />
<span class="large">SIEGE OR ATTACK BY REGULAR APPROACHES.</span></h2>

<h3>PRELIMINARY CONSIDERATIONS, DEFINITIONS, ETC.</h3>

<p id="I_art9"><b>9.</b> By a regular siege is meant a systematic and
more or less deliberate attack upon a fortified place, in
which the besieger aims to invest the place and capture
its fortifications in succession by regular approaches,
beginning with the most advanced and ending only
with the reduction of the innermost keep and the
surrender of the garrison.</p>

<p>The successive steps of a siege are usually the following:</p>

<p>The investment.</p>

<p>The artillery attack.</p>

<p>The construction of parallels and approaches.</p>

<p>Breaching by artillery or mines.</p>

<p>The final assault.</p>

<p>The introduction of modern breech-loading rifled
guns, howitzers and mortars, rapid-fire and machine
guns, and magazine small arms has brought with it the
need of a higher grade of mechanical skill and improved
machinery for making the ordinary repairs.
This imposes upon both attack and defence the necessity
for providing machine shops and tools fitted for
work of this kind, with the steam power required to
drive them. In connection with these, steam sawmills
and other simple wood-working machines should
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
be provided, as well as all other available labor-saving
appliances which can be used to lighten the labor of
the troops.</p>

<p>Portable tools, such as picks, shovels, crowbars,
rammers, axes, hatchets, bill-hooks, gabion-knives,
hammers, saws, carpenters', joiners' and blacksmiths'
tools, etc., etc., must be provided.</p>

<p id="I_art10"><b>10.</b> The principal <b>special tools and appliances</b>
used are the following, viz.: sap-forks, sand-bag forks,
scrapers, sap-shields, measuring-rods of various lengths,
pocket compasses with attachments for fastening them
to measuring-rods, tracing-lanterns, dark and ordinary
lanterns, tracing tape or cord, tracing pickets or stakes,
fascines, gabions, hurdles, sand-bags, blindage and gallery
frames and sheeting, etc., etc.</p>

<p>The <i>sap-fork</i> and <i>sand-bag fork</i> (<a href="#pl_01">Pl. I</a>, Figs. 1 and 2),
about 4½ and 4 feet long, respectively, have steel
heads with three and four prongs, as shown in the
figures, those of the sap-fork being sharp and those of
the sand-bag fork blunt.</p>

<p>They are used for handling and placing gabions,
fascines, and sand-bags in position when, without their
use, the sappers' arms would be exposed to fire.</p>

<p>The <i>scraper</i> (<a href="#pl_01">Pl. I</a>, Fig. 3) is a large hoe, of about the
dimensions given in the figure, used for levelling off
the surface of parapets, etc.</p>

<p>The <i>sap-shield</i>, introduced by the English (<a href="#pl_01">Pl. I</a>,
Figs. 4 and 6), is a flat plate of mild steel 3 feet 6
inches by 1 foot 9 inches × ¼ inch, with two handles
on its back as shown. Total weight, about 80 lbs.</p>

<p>It may be used as shown in the figure, and sometimes
by small parties as a body-shield in such operations
as blowing in gates, etc., etc.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span></p>

<p><i>Measuring-rods</i> of rectangular cross-section, straight
and divided into feet and inches, are needed for special
purposes; but the ordinary rods are cut from round
brush wood and to the length required.</p>

<p><i>Tracing-tape</i> is usually a white tape, about 1½ inches
wide, in lengths of 150 feet, marked at equal intervals,
usually 5 feet, by short pieces of tape sewed to it. A
loop of strong cord is fastened to each end. For convenience
in use it is ordinarily rolled into a ball.</p>

<p><i>Tracing-pickets</i> are about 18 inches long and one
inch in diameter. To make them visible in a dim light
the bark is removed from them. <i>Ordinary pickets</i> are
usually 3½ or 4 feet long, 1½ to 1¾ inches in diameter,
sharpened to a triangular point.</p>

<p>The <i>tracing-lantern</i> (<a href="#pl_01">Pl. I</a>, Fig. 5) is a dark lantern
with a reflector arranged to throw a light vertically
downward.</p>

<p>The other tools, materials, and appliances above mentioned,
not of the ordinary commercial patterns, are

<span class="large">TRENCHES, APPROACHES, PARALLELS, SAPS,
SPLINTER PROOFS, AND PASSAGE OF
THE DITCH.</span></h2>

<p id="I_art11"><b>11.</b> <b>Trenches.</b>&mdash;A <i>military trench</i> consists of a ditch
and embankment affording cover from direct fire.
Trenches are used for <i>approaches</i> (or <i>boyaux</i>), <i>parallels</i>,
and <i>communications</i> with magazines, etc.</p>

<p id="I_art12"><b>12.</b> <b>Parallels</b> are trenches which take their name
from the fact that they usually are located on lines approximately
parallel to the general front of attack. In
a regular siege at least three and frequently a greater
number of parallels are used. The exterior one, which
is first made, is known as the <i>first parallel</i>, the next
one as the <i>second parallel</i>, and so on. They are used to
cover the part of the besieging force known as “<i>the
guard of the trenches</i>,” which protects the men making
the approaches, etc., and also as “places of arms” for
assembling troops for assault or for other purposes.</p>

<p>The trench of a parallel is usually 10 feet wide at
the bottom and 4 feet deep, finished on the reverse
with a slope and on the front with two steps and a
berm, with treads of 18 inches and rises of 15-18
inches (<a href="#pl_01">Pl. I</a>, Figs. 7 to 13).</p>

<p>The parapet of the parallel should not be higher
than 4 feet 6 inches. Its upper surface, particularly in
the second and third parallels, should be made approximately
plain with a scraper, and its interior slope should
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
be finished and if necessary revetted, so as to afford a
good infantry-fire. To allow the troops to move out
to the front in line, portions of the interior slope should
be cut into steps of not more than about 18 inches
rise, and be revetted with fascines or other materials
(<a href="#pl_01">Pl. I</a>, Figs. 12 and 13). These portions should be 25
or more yards long and near the approaches. If a
general assault is to be made, the parallels must be
similarly arranged for the necessary length of front.</p>

<p id="I_art13"><b>13.</b> <b>Approaches</b> are trenches leading up toward the
fortification on the front of attack; they connect the
parallels and give protection to the besiegers in moving
back and forth. To avoid enfilading fire they usually
run in zigzags (<a href="#pl_08">Pl. VIII</a>, Figs. 80 and 81) across the
capitals of the work, with branches seldom exceeding
100 yards in length at the first parallel, and growing
continually shorter as they approach the work. Each
branch is so directed that its prolongation will pass
from 30 to 40 yards outside the most advanced position
within effective range held by the defence. At each
turning-point of the zigzag the more advanced branch
is prolonged from 10 to 20 or more yards to the rear,
to cover the angle of the approach. These returns are
also useful for storing trench material, etc.</p>

<p>After the return is completed the sharp angle in the
trench is rounded off to allow gun-carriages, etc., to
make the turn.</p>

<p>Approaches are usually 4 feet deep, 9 to 12 feet wide
at bottom, with slopes in front and rear as steep as the
earth will stand, and have a rough parapet not less than
4½ feet high, separated from the trench by a berm of 18
inches, or more if necessary (<a href="#pl_08">Pl. VIII</a>, Fig. 82). When
drainage requires it, as it very frequently does, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
bottom of the trench is sloped from front to rear about
6 inches; a ditch cut along the reverse slope, discharging
into the drainage ditches of the vicinity, or into
drainage pits excavated in rear of and outside the approaches.
These may be lined with a gabion to prevent
their sides falling in.</p>

officers after careful reconnoissance of the ground.
Guiding points and lines are marked so as to be readily
found in the dusk, but so that they cannot be seen by
the defence. When completely screened from view important
points are marked by posting sappers at them.</p>

<p>When no other practicable method can be used, the
directions are determined by the use of a pocket compass
fastened to a straight measuring-rod.</p>

<p>Tracing is begun as soon as the approaching darkness
will conceal the parties from the defence, while close objects
are still visible. The length of parallel traced by
each officer should not exceed that occupied by one
unit, usually a battalion, as a working party. (A battalion
of 500 men will occupy 800 yards).</p>

<p>The tracing party consists of one officer, one N. C.
officer, and one sapper to each 50 yards of parallel, with
one or two extra men.</p>

<p>The officer is provided with a pocket compass and
measuring-rod. The N. C. officer has a tracing-lantern
and a mallet with muffled head. Each sapper carries a
roll of tracing-tape, a tracing-picket, and a six-foot
measuring-rod. The officer stations the first sapper at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
the initial point, and, taking one end of his tracing-tape,
moves along the line of the parallel, accompanied by the
rest of the sappers; the first sapper places his picket
between his feet, and the N. C. officer drives it into the
ground far enough to make it secure. The sapper drops
the ball of tape on the ground and lets it run out through
his hands until nearly out, when he checks it, and when it
is all out places the loop over his picket and lies down
to await the arrival of the working party. The N. C.
officer, as soon as he has driven the first picket, follows
on to the second, etc.</p>

<p>The officer, having run out the tape of the first sapper,
halts the second, takes the end of his tape, and proceeds
as before until the parallel is traced, and a sapper is left
at each 50 yards of its length. Each sapper is told the
designation, by number and section, of the point he
occupies.</p>

<p id="I_art15"><b>15.</b> <b>Tracing Approaches.</b>&mdash;The approaches are
traced in the same manner as the parallels, but at each
turning point of the zigzags a picket is driven, around
which the tape is carried. After tracing the branch in
front, the tape is cut at five yards in rear of the picket,
and the end carried out to the rear in prolongation of
the branch in front to indicate “the return,” which is
then prolonged to the proper length (from 10 to 20
yards) by a short piece of tracing-tape.</p>

<h3 id="Posting_Working_Parties">POSTING THE WORKING PARTIES.</h3>

<p id="I_art16"><b>16.</b> The working parties are commanded by their
own officers, under the guidance of the engineers. They
carry their arms and ammunition. Each battalion (or
other unit) is marched in column to the depots, where
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
the tools are laid out in lines, so that each man can
take up his pick and shovel when drawn up in front of
them. But when time does not allow of this arrangement,
they are piled, the picks in one pile, the shovels
in another, and the men pass the piles in single file to
the right of the picks and the left of the shovels, each
man receiving a pick and shovel as he passes the pile.
If gabions are to be carried, they are distributed in a
similar way. When two are carried, the shovel is secured
inside one and the pick inside the other, and the
gabions are then carried by the picket inserted for that
purpose. When one only is carried, the pick is usually
secured inside it, the gabion carried on the shoulder,
and the shovel in the hand.</p>

<p>The working party, in column, provided with its
tools, etc., is then led by the engineer officer to the
parallel, and forms on right (or left) into line along it in
single rank at five-foot intervals, beginning at the initial
point of each section.</p>

<p>The N. C. officer of engineers assists in this formation,
and each sapper points out to the men of the working
party the five-foot intervals marked upon the tracing-tape
of his 50 yards, verifies their positions along it,
and subsequently superintends their work. Each man
when properly placed drives his pick into the ground at
the left of his task, places his shovel beside it, and lies
down until the command “Commence work” is given.</p>

<p>When gabions are used the working party is posted
in a manner entirely similar, except that the column is
of necessity formed in single rank when marching to
the initial point. The men form on right (or left) into
line and place their gabions in front of the tape and
touching each other; each man then takes out his tools,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
places them behind the gabions, lies down, and awaits
the command to commence work. The sapper sees
that the gabions of his 50 yards are properly aligned
and touch each other throughout.</p>

<p>Both the sappers and working parties are divided into
reliefs, usually of eight hours. The sappers of the tracing
parties superintend the work of the first relief of
the working party, but are relieved long enough before
them (½ hour to 1 hour) for the second relief to become
acquainted with the details of its sections before the
second relief of the working party arrives. A similar
arrangement is made for the third relief.</p>

<h3 id="EXECUTION_OF_PARALLELS_AND_APPROACHES">EXECUTION OF PARALLELS AND APPROACHES.</h3>

<p id="I_art17"><b>17.</b> <b>Simple Trench.</b>&mdash;A trench made by excavating
the earth and forming a parapet without revetment of
any kind is known as a “<i>simple trench</i>,” or as “<i>simple
trench-work</i>.”</p>

<p><i>Flying sap</i> or <i>flying trench-work</i>.&mdash;When, in order to
obtain cover more quickly, gabions are used to hold the
earth first excavated, and subsequently to serve as a
revetment to the interior slope of the parapet, the
trench is known as a “<i>flying sap</i>” or “<i>flying trench-work</i>.”</p>

<p id="I_art18"><b>18.</b> <b>Construction by Simple Trench.</b>&mdash;The first
parallel and the distant approaches are usually constructed
by the use of the simple trench, as follows,
viz. (<a href="#pl_01">Pl. I</a>, Figs. 9 and 10): The men having been
posted along the tracing-tape at five-foot intervals, as
previously described, and their positions verified by
the engineer officers, the command “Commence
work” is given. Each man marks the left and front
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
of his task by a line dug with his pick, and, commencing
at the left of his task, at once excavates a
trench 3 feet long, 1½ feet deep, and 6½ feet wide,
throwing the earth to the front, and making a parapet
1½ feet high, leaving a berm of 1½ feet. Then, commencing
at 1½ feet from the front of his trench, he
deepens it to 4 feet, making the parapet 3 feet high.
When the task of a party is finished each man cleans
off his pick and shovel, places them at the rear of the
trench, and leaves them there for the use of the second
relief.</p>

<p>By excavating in this way, partial cover while at work
and a defensible parapet are rapidly obtained, and, at
the completion of the task, the parapet admits of a
strong defence, and affords cover sufficient to allow
the first relief to be withdrawn and the second to be
posted without exposure. Special care must be taken
during the work to make the men face toward the
parapet while digging, in order to avoid striking their
neighbors with the pick when raising it for a blow.</p>

<p>The second relief widens the trench 4 feet; forms a
bottom step 18 inches wide with such materials as are
available; heightens the parapet to 4½ feet, and throws
the rest of the earth to the front to thicken it (<a href="#pl_01">Pl. I</a>,
Fig. 8).</p>

<p>The third relief widens the trench 2½ feet at the
bottom and slopes off the reverse as steep as the earth
will stand. The earth is used to thicken the parapet,
additional shovels and shovellers being provided if
found necessary.</p>

<p>The approaches (<a href="#pl_08">Pl. VIII</a>, Fig. 82) are extended in
a similar manner; the tasks of the reliefs are marked
on the sections.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span></p>

<p>Variations from these sections are made when rendered
necessary by the presence of rock or water in
the soil (<a href="#pl_01">Pl. I</a>, Fig. 11); when a wider trench is
required for a tramway or for free communication; or,
in special cases, when a narrower trench will answer
the purpose and save work. Should a specially heavy
fire make additional cover necessary, it may be obtained
by deepening the ditch and thickening the
parapet, leaving its crest at the same height. The
sections above given have been found best for ordinary
cases.</p>

<p id="I_art19"><b>19.</b> <b>Construction by Flying Sap.</b>&mdash;The construction
of the first parallel having indicated to the defence
the front of attack, further operations will usually be
subject to a more destructive small-arm and machine-gun
fire. This will, as the siege advances, render the
losses experienced in constructing a simple trench too
extravagant, and a quicker method of obtaining cover
must be used. This method is found in the flying sap
(<a href="#pl_01">Pl. I</a>, Figs. 8 and 13), which is executed as follows,
viz.:</p>

<p>The men are posted and the gabions placed as previously
described. The engineer officer having
marked the lines, the order “Commence work” is
given. Each man marks with his pick the front and
left of his task (which in this case is 4 × 6½ feet,
leaving a berm of 1½ feet), and proceeds at once to dig
on its left, filling first the left gabion, next the right,
and then throwing the earth over and in front of the
gabions. Each gabion, when it is half filled, is tipped
outward until it has a slope of about 4 on 1. The
filling is then completed.</p>

<p>As each man of the first relief occupies only 4 feet
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
of front (2 gabions), his task is four-fifths as great as it
is in executing the simple trench.</p>

<p>The second and third reliefs have the same tasks as
in the simple trench. When the first relief finishes its
task, every fifth workman (indicated by the sapper of
the section) retains his pick and shovel and returns
them to the depot when he marches past it.</p>

<p>The others leave their tools for the use of the second
and third reliefs. In good soil the gabions may be
filled in from 7 to 15 minutes.</p>

<p>The English sap-shield is designed for use when
the fire is so severe that the flying sap with gabions
becomes impracticable. Owing to its weight (80
lbs.) a man can carry but one; hence a carrying party
equal to the working party assists in placing the
shields and then retires. This gives to each workman
a task of 3½ × 6½ feet.</p>

<p>The shields are placed as shown in <a href="#pl_01">Pl. I</a>, Fig. 6; the
trench is executed as previously described, the earth
being thrown over and beyond the shield. The shields
are removed after the task of the first relief is finished.</p>

<p>The sap-shield is designed to be used in special cases
for covering the head of a full sap (described further
on), in which case it is placed as shown on <a href="#pl_01">Pl. I</a>,
Fig. 4; and also as a body cover for a man moving for
a short distance in the face of a heavy fire, as is necessary
at times in sapping and mining operations. It
has not yet stood the test of service in a siege.</p>

<h3 id="SPLINTER-PROOF_COVER">SPLINTER-PROOF COVER.</h3>

<p id="I_art20"><b>20.</b> <b>Splinter-proofs</b> for the guards of the trenches,
for field-hospitals, latrines, etc., should be provided as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
soon as possible after the parallels are finished. They
may be placed in the returns of the approaches, or in
rear of the parallels, and be connected with them by
trenches. <a href="#pl_02">Pl. II</a>, Figs. 14-16, show their construction
when in rear of the parallel and revetted with logs,
fascines, or sawn lumber. The trench is 9 feet wide by
4½ feet deep. Its front edge should be 25 or 30 feet
in rear of the reverse slope of the parallel. This width
of trench will allow 2 to 4 men per yard of its
length to work advantageously. They should finish
it in 8 hours.</p>

<p>In digging the trench the earth is thrown out on
both sides, leaving a berm of about 1½ feet on each
side to allow the woodwork to be properly placed.
When this is completed the earth in rear is thrown
forward to complete the cover, as shown in the plate.</p>

<p>Steps for egress and openings for light and ventilation
may be placed at intervals along the rear, and,
when desirable, bunks may be built, as shown in the
figures.</p>

<p>When the splinter-proofs are built in the returns of
the approaches, the overhead cover may extend entirely
across, steps and openings being provided as in
the previous case; or posts and longitudinal beams
may be set in the trench to hold up the rear end of
the cross-beams, leaving the rear of the splinter-proof
open. Portions of this may be closed, if desired, by
leaning short posts or fascines against the longitudinal
beam and banking earth against them.</p>

<p>The splinter-proofs may generally be drained into
the parallels or approaches. When this cannot be done
drainage-pits must be used. Limited portions of the
splinter-proofs may be protected against leakage through
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
the earth cover by first filling over the covering beams
with earth, packing it to a smooth surface with a gentle
slope, placing upon it raw hides, roofing felt or other
waterproof material, and then completing the cover by
adding the necessary thickness of earth, giving finally
to its top surface a slope to carry off the rain.</p>

<h3 id="Bomb-proofs">BOMB-PROOFS.</h3>

<p id="I_art21"><b>21.</b> When, in the close attack of the work, the besiegers
are subject to vertical fire from small mortars,
better overhead cover must be obtained by bomb-proofs,
constructed by deepening the trench, using
stronger beams, and a greater thickness of earth.
Twelve-inch timbers laid touching each other, with
spans of 5 feet and 5 feet of earth cover, have been
considered sufficient; but with the improvement of
high-angle fire and the use of high-explosive shells
greater protection will be needed in the future. Experimental
data for fixing the amount is not now available;
an approximate thickness of earth cover may be
computed as indicated below.</p>

<p>The mining effect of dynamite in common earth
is something less than twice that of an equal weight
of gunpowder. (See Military Mining, <a href="#II_art13">Arts. 13</a> and
<a href="#II_art14">14.</a>)</p>

<p>An explosive enclosed in a strong case, however, expends
a part of the energy due to explosion in rupturing
this case. The stronger the explosive the less will
be the percentage of the total energy required for
breaking the case, and the greater the percentage remaining
for performing other work. For this reason
equal weights of high explosives and of gunpowder enclosed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
in strong shells will not produce the same relative
effects in forming craters, &amp;c., that they would if
contained in paper cases. The effect of the high explosive
is relatively much greater when contained in a
strong shell. Experiments made at Fort Hamilton,
1890-91, with 8-inch shells loaded with explosive gelatine,
showed this explosive to have between 4 and 5
times the effect of gunpowder, while in paper cases the
relative effects were as 1.7 to 1.0. (See Report of Board
of Ordnance and Fortification, Ex. Doc. No. 12, 52d
Congress, 1st Session, January 5th, 1892.)</p>

<p>Since the mining effects of the charges contained in
shells are, however, less than when packed in thin cases,
the thickness of cover determined by the use of the
usual mining formulas should err on the side of
safety.</p>

<p>Knowing the charge contained in shells to be fired
against a bomb-proof, and their probable penetration,
the formulas given in <a href="#II_art7">Arts. 7</a> to 12, Military Mining,
may be used for finding equivalent common mines and
radii of rupture for dynamite and explosive gelatine by
substituting in them <sup>1</sup>/<sub>17</sub> for <sup>1</sup>/<sub>10</sub>.</p>

<p>The values given in <a href="#II_art11">Art. 11</a> will probably be sufficiently
accurate for the radii of rupture. The cover
given in the direction of the fire must be greater than
the sum of the penetration and the radius of rupture.</p>

<p>When the penetration is equal to or greater than
twice the L. L. R. of an equivalent common mine a
camouflet will probably be formed, whose radius of
rupture, from the formulas, will be equal in all directions
and may be assumed as ⅕ of the L. L. R. of the
equivalent common mine.</p>

<p>In this connection, see par. 61, p. 58.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span></p>

<h3 id="SAPPING">SAPPING.</h3>

<p id="I_art22"><b>22.</b> When the trenches have been carried so near the
work that the simple or flying trench cannot be used
without undue loss, recourse must be had to the <i>sap</i>.</p>

<p>A <b>sap</b> is a narrow trench (subsequently widened),
which is continually prolonged in the desired direction
by digging away the earth at its head and throwing it
to the front and exposed flank as a cover for the working
party.</p>

<p>When the sap is subject to an oblique front-fire, exposing
one flank only, the parapet is constructed on that
flank and at the head. This is known as a <i>single</i> or
<i>full sap</i>. When both flanks and the head of the sap
are exposed to fire two full saps are driven parallel and
very near to each other, each with its parapet on the
outer flank. The tongue of earth left between them is
removed to widen the narrow trenches, thus making a
single trench with a parapet on each side. This is
called a “<i>double sap</i>.”</p>

<p>The trench is sometimes deepened and given a splinter-proof
roof or cover. This is known as a “<i>blinded
sap</i>.” A sap gaining ground to the right and front is
called a “<i>right-handed sap</i>;” its parapet is on its left
flank. A “<i>left-handed sap</i>” has its parapet on its right
flank.</p>

<p>To expedite the work in sapping several reliefs should
be employed, and task-work should be adopted to induce
the men to work rapidly.</p>

<p>In all sapping operations the use of the simple trench
and flying sap will be resumed when circumstances admit
without involving too great losses.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span></p>

<p id="I_art23"><b>23. The full sap</b> (<a href="#pl_02">Pl. II</a>, Figs. 17-21) requires a
detachment, or “<b>brigade</b>,” of 1 non-commissioned
officer and 8 men, provided with the following tools,
viz.:</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td style="vertical-align: top">For</td>
    <td style="vertical-align: top">No. 1,</td>
    <td>a miner’s pick, a miner’s shovel, a measuring-rod,

    <td>a shovel and a scraper with a handle 9'

  </tr></table>

<p>For the rest of the detachment, a 6' measuring-rod,
knee-caps for 4 men, 2 shovels and 1 pick (in reserve),
and, when necessary, a crowbar, axe, and bill-hook.
From 100 to 150 sand-bags are supplied to each detachment.</p>

<p id="I_art24"><b>24. Organization and Duties of the Detachment.</b>&mdash;The
sappers are numbered 1, 2, 3, and 4 in each rank;
the front rank extends the sap 1 yard and is then relieved
by the rear rank, and so alternately. The sappers
change places at each relief; those who serve as
Nos. 1 and 2 during their first task becoming Nos. 3 and
4 during the second, and so on throughout their tour.</p>

<p>If a detachment is reduced below 8 in number by
casualties it nevertheless keeps 4 men at work driving
the sap, and reduces its reserve until new men are supplied.</p>

<p id="I_art25"><b>25. Driving the Sap.</b>&mdash;The sap is driven as follows,
viz.: Nos. 1 and 2 dig a ditch 4' 6" deep, 1' 6" wide at
bottom, and 3' or more at top; the berm side has a slope
of 3/1, and the reverse is vertical, or as nearly so as the
earth will stand. They leave no berm, as they need all
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
the cover they can get. Nos. 3 and 4 widen this trench
2 feet and form a berm of 1' 6" by digging away the foot
of the parapet and throwing the earth upon its top and
exterior slope. The head of their work is kept at 9' in
rear of the head of the sap.</p>

<p>The side parapet made by Nos. 1 and 2 is about 2' 6"
high and bullet-proof (about 2' 6" to 3' thick) at 18
inches above the ground. The head parapet is made
up of about 60 sand-bags, from ½ to 2⅔ filled. It joins
the side parapet and extends across the head of the sap.
It is about 2' 6" high.</p>

<p>As the sap is driven forward the head parapet is advanced
by throwing the rear sand-bags over to the front
by hand or by the use of the sand-bag fork. In excavating
the trench No. 1 kneels down, undermines, and
digs down enough earth to advance his trench about 9
inches. He is replaced by No. 2, who shovels this earth
upon the side parapet toward the head of the sap. No. 1
then resumes his place and throws the sand-bags at the
head of the trench over the parapet until he has uncovered
about a foot in advance. He uses a sand-bag fork
when necessary. The trench is advanced 9 inches more
in the same manner. No. 2, besides throwing out the
earth dug by No. 1, trims up the slopes and gives the
trench its proper width and depth.</p>

<p>Nos. 1 and 2 change places when they have advanced
the head of the sap 1' 6", and are relieved as before
stated when 3 feet is gained.</p>

<p>Nos. 3 and 4 work together upon their task. In
shovelling the earth upon the parapet they throw it
somewhat toward the front and regulate its height with
the scraper. The rate of advance is usually from 2 to
4 feet per hour.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span></p>

<p><i>Widening the Sap.</i>&mdash;The sap is widened by working
parties, usually of infantry, who work at about, but not
less than, 25 feet in rear of the head of the sap. In an
approach their task is equal in volume to that of the
sappers, and can be finished in one relief. In a parallel
when steps are to be provided, a second relief makes the
steps, drainage ditches, drainage pits, etc.</p>

<p><i>A change of direction</i> in a full sap (<a href="#pl_02">Pl. II</a>, Fig. 20) is
made by No. 1 turning in the new direction and working
through the old side parapet; No 2 throwing the
earth over the old head parapet. The sand-bags of the
old are gradually removed and used for a new head
parapet, 20 or 30 additional sand-bags being ready for
use if needed before the others can be safely removed.
Nos. 3 and 4 follow on as before.</p>

<p>A <i>return</i> can be driven back when desired by another
detachment of sappers. No head parapet will be needed,
but the side parapet will be kept a little in advance of
the head of the sap.</p>

<p id="I_art26"><b>26.</b> <b>Breaking Out a Sap from a Parallel.</b>&mdash;The
head parapet of a sap is about 2' 6" high. The parapet
of a parallel is about 4' 6" high. A sap of the
usual form driven through the parapet of a parallel will
expose the latter to fire through the opening formed.
To reduce the danger from this exposure, the sap is
broken out at night, and to cover the opening in the
shortest time two or three men may creep over the
parapet of the parallel and cover themselves by rapidly
digging a hole, from which they may work back and
join the sappers, who are working outward. The sap
being driven obliquely to the front, the trench widened,
and the parapet made full size (<a href="#pl_02">Pl. II</a>, Fig. 21), the
opening will be covered; or a few men may in some
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
cases construct in front of the parallel a short section of
flying sap, under cover of which the full sap may be
broken out (<a href="#pl_03">Pl. III</a>, Fig. 28).</p>

<p>Preliminary preparations for breaking out should be
made during the day, but should be so conducted as
not to indicate the selected point to the enemy.</p>

<p id="I_art27"><b>27.</b> <b>Circular places of arms</b> (<a href="#pl_09">Pl. IX</a>, Fig. 83) may
be formed in front of a parallel by breaking out two
single saps from points 80 to 100 yards apart and so
directing them as to meet at 25 or 30 yards in front of
the parallel. They may be used by the guards of the
trenches or as depots for trench material, etc.</p>

<p id="I_art28"><b>28.</b> <b>Shallow Sap.</b>&mdash;When the presence of water in
the soil or of rock near the surface prevents driving the
full sap 4' 6" deep, a shallow or modified sap (<a href="#pl_02">Pl. II</a>,
Figs. 22 and 23) may be used, provided a trench 3'
deep can be driven forward. In this case Nos. 1 and 2
must both work kneeling, and Nos. 3 and 4 must throw
the earth well to the front and keep the parapet as high
as possible, leaving the construction of the berm to the
widening party, who will give to the trench the necessary
width, and will then obtain earth for strengthening
the parapet by deepening the trench when practicable
and widening it when necessary, making, however, no
irregularities which will injure it as a communication
and no depressions which will collect water. This sap
advances about as rapidly as the full sap.</p>

<p id="I_art29"><b>29.</b> <b>Overground Approaches.</b>&mdash;When the water or
rock comes to the surface of the ground, approaches
can, under favorable circumstances, be driven for short
distances by carrying forward earth in sand-bags, forming
with them head and side parapets, and moving
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
forward by continually building up the latter and advancing
the former as before described.</p>

<p>The expenditure of time, labor, and sand-bags is so
great in driving approaches in this way that the minimum
height of parapet (possibly 5') should be made
with sand-bags. This may be subsequently heightened
and strengthened with earth brought forward in barrows
or hand-carts and thrown upon the top and exterior
slope.</p>

<p id="I_art30"><b>30.</b> <b>Double Sap.</b>&mdash;(<a href="#pl_03">Pl. III</a>, Figs. 24, 25, and 26).&mdash;The
double sap consists of two parallel single saps
driven side by side, the cutting lines of the berms, usually
10 feet apart, making the bottom of the completed
trench 7 feet wide. It is used when the zigzags, to
avoid enfilade, make such a slow advance as to be no
longer profitable, i.e., when the amount gained in advance
does not exceed ⅓ the length driven. The double
sap is directed toward the work, and is exposed to an
enfilading and also to a slant fire from both directions.
It must therefore have a parapet in front and on both
flanks.</p>

<p id="I_art31"><b>31.</b> <b>Execution of the Double Sap.</b>&mdash;The double sap
is driven by two detachments, each organized and
equipped exactly as for a single sap, except that a
greater number of sand-bags should be supplied when
practicable. The sappers work as in driving a single
sap, with the following modifications only: The Nos. 1
prolong their head parapets until they meet, and in advancing
their heads of sap leave undisturbed the 4 feet
of head parapet intervening between their trenches, but,
by continually throwing sand-bags or earth obliquely to
the front, keep the head parapet continuous and nearly
straight.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span></p>

<p>This leaves between the trenches made by the Nos.
1 and 2 of the two detachments a tongue of earth 4 feet
thick, surmounted with a parapet about 2' or 2' 6"
high, which serves as a parados and protects these sappers
from reverse fire.</p>

<p>Nos. 3 and 4 of both detachments, in completing
their tasks, remove this tongue and pass forward the
sand-bags forming its parapet for use by Nos. 1 and 2;
otherwise the tasks are as in driving a single sap. When
sufficient sand-bags are not available the middle part
of the head parapet must be made of loose earth, giving
much less protection to Nos. 1 and 2.</p>

<p>This sap, from its method of construction, is completed
by the sappers without the assistance of the infantry
working parties. Its rate of advance is about
the same as that of the single sap.</p>

<p id="I_art32"><b>32.</b> <b>Changing Direction of a Double Sap.</b>&mdash;When
a change of direction is to be made No. 1 of the first
detachment marks on the berm the width of the top of
the trench (10'), Nos. 1 and 2 of the wheeling flank
come around the tongue and the leading sappers of the
two detachments start their sap-heads in the new direction.
Nos. 3 and 4 of both detachments remove the
tongue of earth and complete the parapets of the original
trench and then follow up their Nos. 1 and 2 as
before.</p>

<p id="I_art33"><b>33.</b> <b>Breaking Out a Double Sap from a Parallel.</b>&mdash;A
double sap is broken out by methods entirely similar
to those already described for the single sap (<a href="#pl_03">Pl. III</a>,
Figs. 27 and 28). The figures explain themselves.</p>

<p id="I_art34"><b>34.</b> <b>Traversed Sap.</b>&mdash;A sap may be traversed to
protect it against enfilade by frequent changes of direction,
generally rectangular (<a href="#pl_03">Pl. III</a>, Figs. 29, 30, and 31),
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
or by making hollow traverses by blinding the sap at
points separated by limited distances (<a href="#pl_03">Pl. III</a>, Figs. 32-35).</p>

<p>In traversing a double sap by change of direction, a
single sap is broken out to the right or left (or one in
each direction) and pushed forward to the desired
length. From the flank of this the double sap is again
broken out and driven to the front until another traverse
is required. When the saps are driven to both
right and left a double sap is driven to the front from
the extremity of each, and at the next change of direction
the single saps are driven towards each other until
they meet, and the double sap is driven in the prolongation
of its original direction. This forms what is
called a <i>cube traverse</i>, and gives additional room in the
communications. The single sap is used in making traverses,
since by throwing all the earth on one side better
cover is given. When the sap is so far advanced that
it becomes subject to a reverse fire the double sap will
have to be used in making the traverses.</p>

<p><i>Length of Traverses.</i>&mdash;Traverses should extend at
least 12 feet beyond the trench in their rear, which will
give them a length of from 25 to 30 feet on the berm.
The salient angles of the sides of the trenches should
be rounded as much as practicable to allow the easy
passage of guns, and those of the parapets should, when
necessary to screen the trench, be held as nearly vertical
as practicable by sand-bags. Ramps leading to the
surface of the ground may be made in rear of the traverses
when needed. For guns they are 8' wide, with
slope not greater than ¼. The work in making traverses
being considerable, they should be spaced as far apart
as practicable.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span></p>

<p><i>Spacing Traverses.</i>&mdash;In driving the sap to the front
the low head parapet of the sap will defilade a less
length in the rear than would the finished parapet of
the traverse, which is from 2 to 3 feet higher. The sap
is, nevertheless, pushed forward to as great a length as
will be defiladed by the traverse when finished, the
sappers meanwhile passing the partly protected portion
by stooping or creeping when necessary.</p>

<p id="I_art35"><b>35.</b> <b>Traverse by Blinded Sap.</b>&mdash;In traversing a sap
by blinding a part of its length (<a href="#pl_03">Pl. III</a>, Figs. 32-35) the
sap is first deepened 2 feet over this part; mine-cases,
frames similar to mining-frames, or regular blindage-frames
(see Military Mining, <a href="#II_art53">Arts. 53</a>-55) are then put
in position, the side slopes are held up by sheeting,
when necessary, and the top is covered with sheeting,
fascines, rails, or other material; earth is then thrown
upon the top to bring it up to the desired height for a
traverse, which will usually give at least 3 feet of earth
covering. When a considerable thickness of earth is to
be used the frames must be made correspondingly
strong. For a clear opening, 6 feet at bottom, 8 feet
at top, and 6' 6" high the English engineers recommend
frames at 3-foot intervals, with 6-inch square
posts, 2-inch thick sills, and 9 inch × 6 inch caps 12
feet long. The end frames should be braced against
outward thrust by 6" × 6" struts.</p>

<p>These traverses are usually made at least 20 feet in
length. They can be used only when good drainage
can be secured.</p>

<p id="I_art36"><b>36.</b> <b>Crowning the Covered Way</b> (<a href="#pl_04">Pl. IV</a>, Fig. 36).&mdash;The
traversed sap is used for “<i>crowning the covered
way</i>,” which consists in constructing a battery or infantry
parapet along the crest of the covered way, from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
which a fire can be brought upon the ditch and the
scarp-wall of the work. To accomplish this the sap is
run parallel to the crest, with its nearer cutting line 18
or 20 feet from it. For an infantry trench the traverses
may be of the dimensions already given.</p>

<p>To cover a battery they should be about 33' long.
It will generally be necessary to use the double sap altogether
in their construction, but usually the earth
excavated by Nos. 3 and 4 of both brigades will be
thrown on the parapet next the work, the parapet on
the reverse side formed by Nos. 1 and 2 affording sufficient
cover for constructing the sap and traverses. The
parapet is prepared for infantry fire as described for the
parallels. The emplacements for guns, the service
magazines, etc., etc., are prepared and the embrasures
are cut, or the parapet prepared for the overbank carriages
at the last moment, under cover of the small-arm
and machine-gun fire from the parallels and places of
arms, and the artillery fire from batteries, which do not
endanger the working parties.</p>

<p id="I_art37"><b>37.</b> <b>Trench Cavalier.</b>&mdash;In order to obtain a greater
plunge upon the covered way and ditch, short lengths
of double sap are sometimes run at right angles to the
direction of the crests of the covered way at about 30
yards outside its salient. The parapet on the side of
the sap towards the work is thrown forward and built
up to the desired height with gabions and sand-bags,
and provided with steps and sand-bag loopholes, giving
a short length of parapet with considerable command,
firing directly along the covered way at short range.</p>

<p>This construction is called a <i>Trench cavalier</i>. It will
be seldom, if ever, used in the future.</p>

<p id="I_art38"><b>38.</b> <b>Former Methods of Sapping.</b>&mdash;Before the general
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
introduction of machine and rapid-fire guns and of
small arms of extreme accuracy and penetration saps
were constructed by No. 1 sapper driving a trench
18" × 18", which was enlarged successively by Nos. 2,
3, and 4. Cover for the sappers was obtained by the
use of a sap-roller (a large gabion, 7' 6" long and 4' in
diameter, stuffed with fascines and rods) as a movable
head parapet, and the construction of the side parapet
was expedited by the use of gabions, sap-fagots, etc.
This method cannot be used against an enemy well
equipped with modern weapons. It is referred to only
as a suggestion that a readily improvised modification
of it might be used to capture, with the least possible
loss, a party of rioters, criminals, or other badly-armed
men occupying an isolated house or other cover.</p>

<h3 id="PASSAGE_OF_THE_DITCH">PASSAGE OF THE DITCH.</h3>

<p id="I_art39"><b>39.</b> When breaches which are practicable are made
in both counter-scarp and scarp of a dry ditch an
assault may sometimes be made successfully; but
when the scarp-wall is not breached, or when, for
other reasons, an assault from the crowning of the
covered way is not considered advisable, the ditch
must be crossed and the breach, when made, must be
crowned by regular approaches. This is accomplished
by the use of a <i>sap</i>, <i>single</i> or <i>double</i>, depending upon
whether it is exposed to fire upon one or both flanks.
Owing to the plunging fire of the defence it may be
necessary to make the sap deeper than 4' 6", or in
some cases to <i>blind</i> it for a part or the whole of its
length. It is generally impracticable to drive the sap
down the slope of a breach in the counter-scarp; therefore
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
a <i>blinded descent</i> (Military Mining, pars. 53 and 54)
is used. It is so directed that when the counter-scarp
is reached the floor of the gallery will be at the required
depth below the bottom of the ditch; i.e., at
the depth fixed for the bottom of the sap. When the
small-arm fire of the defence is so severe as to necessitate
blinding the sap from the counter-scarp across the
ditch, it will usually be imperative to provide a <i>shield</i>,
under cover of which the sappers may start the blinded
sap. This may be made of boards covered with bullet-proof
iron-plates, and of such width and length that it
may be carried through the gallery, thrust out into the
ditch, and then turned, placed in position, and blocked
up at such angle and to such height as may be wished,
by men who move on their hands and knees and support
the shield on their backs. Under cover of this
shield the head parapet of the blinded sap may be
thrown up and the sap then driven in the usual way.</p>

<p>For method of breaching by mines, see Military
Mining, pars. 91 and 92.</p>

<p>After breaching the scarp, if an assault is to be made,
the counter-scarp, for a length equal to or greater than
the length of the breach, should be blown down, to
give the assaulting party access to the breach. If the
breach is to be crowned, and approaches are to be
driven against interior retrenchments, a gallery of
descent should be driven to the counter-scarp at one
side of the breach before the assault is made. From
this a trench should be driven to the crowning of the
breach (usually by flying sap), by means of which communication
is maintained between the crowning of the
breach and the exterior.</p>

<p id="I_art40"><b>40.</b> <b>A wet ditch without current</b> may be crossed by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
building a causeway, upon one or each side of which a
parapet is constructed (<a href="#pl_04">Pl. IV</a>, Figs. 37, 38, and 41).</p>

<p>The floor of the gallery of descent should strike the
ditch at about one foot above the level of the water.
The counter-scarp wall having been broken through, a
shield similar to that described in the preceding paragraph
may be used to cover the sappers working at the
outlet of the gallery in the first stages of the succeeding
work. The causeway is built by throwing into the
ditch short fascines or brushwood mats, having bound
up with them stones enough to sink them, broken-stone
gravel or other available material, until the
causeway is 8 or 10 feet long, about one foot above
the level of the water and wide enough for the roadway
and parapets. The head and side parapets are
then constructed with sand-bags, which are passed out
under the shield and piled at its head and sides. The
causeway is continued by throwing material over the
head parapet, and the approach is driven forward
somewhat like a sap. So soon as the head and side
parapets are made the shield may be raised up and
supported upon two or three cross-balks resting upon
the side parapets. It may then be progressively
moved forward and the approach in its rear be blinded
by sappers working under its protection. Unless the
plunge of the fire upon the approach is equal to or
greater than 45° this shield will, however, when vertical,
cover a greater length of trench than when in a
horizontal position. It may, therefore, if desired, be
turned into a vertical position and be supported by a
frame built for that purpose, which can be moved forward
as the approach advances (<a href="#pl_04">Pl. IV</a>, Fig. 41).</p>

<p>When the head of the approach is subjected to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
fire of rifle-bullets only, it may be practicable to dispense
with the head parapet, replacing it with a bullet-proof
screen covering the head of the approach and
with wings extending back and overlapping the side
parapets (<a href="#pl_04">Pl. IV</a>, Fig. 40); the shield floating on a
raft of light logs, or other material which cannot be
sunk by rifle fire. This shield would, of course, be
erected and launched under cover of the one already
referred to. To save sand-bags, etc., the interior slope
of the side parapets may be revetted with gabions about
4' 6" long, resting on two short fascines and crowned
with three others, giving a height of about 6' 3".
Upon these, when necessary, cross-beams are laid and
the blinding of the approach is finished with sand-bags
thrown on top.</p>

<p id="I_art41"><b>41.</b> <b>A wet ditch with current</b>, or one in which the
water level may be varied by the defence, presents
greater difficulties. The method of crossing which
seems most promising is by a causeway made of materials
which will allow the water to pass freely through
it. For this purpose it is usually recommended to use
casks with their heads knocked out, or strong gabions
lashed to balks, so as to form continuous tubes, which
are loaded with stones and sunk with their axes parallel
to the counter-scarp by sappers working under
cover of a shield. When the top of the causeway is
about a foot above the high-water mark it is levelled off
with fascines and the approach driven forward as previously
described. When available, iron or terra-cotta
pipes of large diameter may, perhaps, be advantageously
substituted for casks or gabions. Cormontaigne,
at Philipsburg, in 1734, successfully used floating
bridges of fascines with parapets of gabions and fascines
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
covered with raw hides. Two bridges were made.
They were 128 feet long, 48 feet wide, and 6 feet thick.
The water was about 15 feet deep. To construct and
hold in place, in a strong or varying current, a floating
bridge of sufficient width and depth to support, without
sinking or capsizing, the parapets necessary for
protection against modern small arms and machine
guns is a task presenting such great difficulties that it
will hardly be undertaken, except as a last resort, and
then with a very uncertain issue.</p>

<p>When, however, the fire of the work is nearly or
entirely silenced, a floating bridge of pontoons, casks,
spars, or other materials, with a slightly masked roadway,
may furnish a sufficiently good crossing and may
be constructed with little difficulty and loss.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a>

when it is below the surface as “<i>sunken batteries</i>.”</p>

<p>When they are concealed from the view of the enemy
by natural or artificial screens they are called “<i>screened</i>”
or “<i>masked batteries</i>,” and when on sites which can be

<h3 id="GENERAL_REQUIREMENTS_OF_SIEGE_BATTERIES">GENERAL REQUIREMENTS OF SIEGE BATTERIES.</h3>

<p id="I_art43"><b>43.</b> 1st. A good <i>platform</i> for and sufficient space to
work each gun. The platform must be suited to the
gun used. The space required is about 15 feet front
by 20 to 25 feet depth.</p>

<p>2d. A <i>parapet</i> which cannot be penetrated by the
projectiles which will be fired against it, and which is
high enough to afford cover to the gun and its detachment
against curved fire. A thickness of 30 feet of
earth will usually be enough for the most exposed batteries.
A less thickness may be used when the conditions
justify it. The height of the interior crest above
the terre-plein should not be less than 7½ feet when this
is attainable and may sometimes be greater.</p>

<p>3d. <i>Traverses.</i> Each gun is usually separated from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
the next by a traverse, whose thickness when subject
to enfilade fire is the same as that of the parapet (30
feet); under other circumstances the thickness may be
reduced if deemed advisable, but should, when practicable,
be such that a shell bursting at any point
within it will blow out at the top or on one side only.</p>

<p>4th. <i>Bomb</i> and <i>splinter proofs</i> sufficient to cover the
gun detachment and reserves against vertical fire. The
thickness of cover for these is to be regulated according
to the principles laid down in par. 21.</p>

<p>5th. <i>Magazines</i> which will hold at least 24 hours'
supply of ammunition, besides recesses near the guns
for shells and a few cartridges.</p>

<p>6th. Easy and direct <i>communications</i> for bringing up
the guns and placing them in position; including tramways,
ramps, etc., etc.</p>

<p>7th. <i>Look-outs</i> or <i>observatories</i> from which the effect
of the fire can be seen. These when possible will be
placed in high sheltered places well on the flanks of
the battery and preferably in advance of it. They may
be connected with it by signals, telegraph, or telephone,
when necessary.</p>

<p>8th. <i>Screens.</i>&mdash;Earthen screens should when possible
be thrown up in front of all exposed batteries.</p>

<h3 id="Construction_of_Batteries_for_Field-guns">CONSTRUCTION OF BATTERIES.</h3>

<p id="I_art44"><b>44.</b> <b>Batteries for Field Guns.</b>&mdash;When the place is
invested, the field artillery is placed in positions considered
most advantageous for repelling attacks from
the garrison upon the investing force. <i>Gun-pits</i> (described
in “Field Fortifications”) are usually made at
once for cover for the guns and their detachments.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
When any of these sites are occupied during the siege
the gun-pits may be connected and converted into a
battery as indicated by <a href="#pl_04">Pl. IV</a>, Figs. 42-45.</p>

<p>A similar construction may sometimes be used during
the siege when the artillery fire of the place is
weakened, and it is desirable to place a field battery in
position for reaching some point in the work. As a
rule, however, batteries for field guns will during the
siege be constructed in the same way as are those for
siege guns and howitzers.</p>

<p id="I_art45"><b>45.</b> <b>Batteries for Siege Guns and Howitzers.</b>&mdash;These
may be <i>screened</i> or <i>exposed</i>, <i>sunken</i>, or <i>elevated</i>.
As a rule each battery has a magazine on each flank.
The amount of powder necessary to serve two guns for
24 hours (150 to 200 rounds per gun = 2500 to 6000
lbs.) is as much as it is advisable to have in one magazine,
in order to limit so far as possible the disastrous
effects of an explosion. For this reason the number of
guns in a battery is usually restricted to four. This
number may be increased when necessary, or when
howitzers firing small charges render it unobjectionable.</p>

<p><b>Elevated batteries</b> require much more labor for
their construction and for obtaining cover for the men
and material than the sunken batteries. They are
therefore used only when the target has to be seen and
the gun has to be raised for this purpose, or when
owing to the presence of rock or water in the soil, or
the liability of the site to be flooded it is impracticable
to sink the platforms below the surface. As a rule
they can be constructed only when covered by a
screen either natural or artificial, and then with earth
carried in wheelbarrows, sand-bags, etc., etc.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span></p>

<p><b>Sunken Batteries.</b>&mdash;When constructed under cover
of a screen the depth of the terre-plein of a sunken battery
may be limited by the presence of rock or water in
the soil, the character of the guns and carriages, and the
time available for the work. In a hasty construction
the depth of the terre-plein is usually limited to from 3
to 4 feet, which can be dug out in a short time. When
more time is available the gun platforms may be put at
5 to 6 feet below the surface and the other parts of the
terre-plein may be sunk still lower. This gives but little
height of parapet, and the extra earth may be used for
giving additional thickness of cover to the splinter-proofs
under the traverses and flanks, and also to the
magazines.</p>

<p>A great variety of plans and profiles may be adopted
for batteries of this class, the details of which need not
be given, since they will be modifications of those described
in Field Fortifications and Permanent Fortifications,
and of the exposed battery to be next described.
As they are built under cover of screens and are
not subject to fire during construction, work upon
them may be continuous and by day as well as by
night.</p>

<p id="I_art46"><b>46.</b> <b>Screens.</b>&mdash;The <i>natural screens</i> used for cover are
elevations, woods, hedges, existing buildings, walls, etc.,
etc.</p>

<p><i>Artificial screens</i> may be made by setting out bushes
to imitate hedges or adopting similar devices, which,
however, will usually fail to deceive an active enemy.
A trench with the earth thrown to the front, forming a
glacis-shaped parapet, will, however, generally be effective.
It must be made of such length that the enemy
cannot know the exact position of the battery, and of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
such height and thickness that he cannot afford to expend
enough ammunition to breach it.</p>

<p>This affords not only concealment during construction,
but also a remarkably efficient cover to the battery
against hostile fire.</p>

<p>Screens, natural or artificial, should be from 50 to 100
yards in front of the batteries, so that the enemy’s
aim may not be corrected by seeing the points struck
by his shells.</p>

<p>Unless the screen is of material which will break up
into injurious splinters under hostile fire, only enough
should be removed before opening fire to unmask the
target of each gun, leaving the remainder for concealing
the points struck by shells, even if it affords no
cover against their penetration.</p>

<p id="I_art47"><b>47.</b> <b>Exposed Sunken Battery.</b>&mdash;Before describing
the construction of this battery it is necessary to state
that upon a site fully exposed to the accurate concentrated
fire of a work, directed at night by light balls or
electric lights, it will in general be practicable to construct
batteries only by sapping, and even then with considerable
losses. But these conditions seldom exist,
since in the distant attack it is usually possible to construct
and arm the battery before it is discovered by
the defence, and in the close attack the fire of the defence
is generally so much reduced that some exposure
is justifiable. While the battery to be described is
classed as an “exposed battery,” it is understood that
it may also be constructed under cover of a parallel or
other trench, and that in all cases when practicable a
natural or artificial mask is used to conceal the first
night’s work from the enemy. It is assumed from the
results obtained in practice that, with the material conveniently
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
stored, the battery can be traced, a central
trench and splinter-proof covers be made during the
first night, and the battery finished and armed during
the second.</p>

<p>The general design and details of this battery are due
to the Royal (British) Engineers.</p>

<p id="I_art48"><b>48.</b> <b>Tracing the Battery.</b>&mdash;The battery is traced
under the direction of an engineer officer by one or
two tracing parties, each composed as follows: 1 non-commissioned
officer with a 6-foot measuring-rod and
tracing-lantern, and 4 sappers, one carrying a measuring-tape
and bundles of pickets, one a field-level, one several
tracing-tapes, and one a mallet or hand-axe; about 75
pickets and 1200 feet of tracing-tape should be provided.
The line of fire of the first gun of the battery (<i>xy</i>, <a href="#pl_05">Pl.
V</a>, Fig. 46) is accurately laid out and marked by daylight.
At dusk one party drives a picket at <i>I</i>, where the
directrix crosses the projection of the base of the interior
slope, and from this as an origin lays out the cutting
lines of the central trench, <i>I</i>, <i>II</i>, <i>III</i>, <i>IV</i>, <i>V</i>, <i>I</i>, making
the trench 5 feet wide and of the length required for the
number of guns (= No. of guns × 45'&mdash;10'); commencing
then at a point <i>A</i>, 7' 6" to the left of <i>I</i> and in the
rear cutting line, this party lays out the line <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>, <i>e</i>,
etc., ... <i>m</i>, <i>n</i>, <i>o</i>, as indicated, the direction <i>n</i>, <i>o</i>, leading
to the parallel.</p>

<p>The second party, beginning at <i>A</i>, lays out <i>A</i>, <i>B</i>,
<i>C</i>, communicating with the parallel, and then the inner
cutting line of the ditch <i>D</i>, <i>E</i>, <i>F</i>, <i>G</i>, <i>H</i>, <i>I</i>, allowing for
a thickness of parapet of 30 feet and an ultimate width
of ditch of 12 feet (<i>D</i>, <i>E</i>, and <i>H</i>, <i>I</i>).</p>

<p>Two parties should trace the battery in 25 minutes,
one party in 45 minutes.

<p id="I_art49"><b>49.</b> <b>Constructing the Central Passage and Splinter
Proofs.</b>&mdash;The first relief of working party for the
central passage is posted and commences work at once
(<a href="#pl_05">Pl. V</a>, Figs. 47-48). Each man’s task is 5 feet in length
and 4 feet in depth (giving 100 cubic feet). It may be
completed in 4 hours, and should be in 6 at most.</p>

<p>The second relief (<a href="#pl_05">Pl. V</a>, Figs. 49-52) excavates the
cartridge recesses, trims up the work done by the first
relief, lowers any earth that stands too high, revets the
slopes of the gun portions, puts in frames and sheeting
when needed in the splinter-proofs, places the bearing
planks and balks of the latter, which should be at least
9 inches thick and 9 feet long, except over the cartridge
recesses, where they are 12 feet, and when possible deepens
the central passage under the splinter-proofs to 5'
6" for a width of 2 feet to form a seat for the men. It
also places one or two planks along the passage to serve
as a bench for shells. The latter part of this work can
be done by daylight. The parapet formed by this excavation
is about 2 feet high. This is so masked or so inconspicuous
as not to draw upon itself the artillery fire
of the defence. The construction of the battery will be
continued usually on the following night.</p>

<p id="I_art50"><b>50.</b> <b>Construction of the Battery</b> (Pls. V and VI,
Figs. 53, 55, 60, 67).&mdash;Two reliefs are required for this.
<i>The first relief</i> receives its tools and arrives upon the
ground at dusk. It is divided into four parties, one
for the front ditch, one for the gun portions, one for
the rear trench, and a reserve of ten per cent for substitutes
and casualties. They are posted and supervised
by the engineer officer, n. c. o<sup>s</sup>., and sappers as
described in paragraph 16, <i>ante</i>.</p>

<p><i>The Front-ditch Party.</i>&mdash;Each digger is assigned a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
task 5' wide, 6' long, and 3' 6" deep. He throws the
earth as far into the parapet as he can. The shovellers,
one to each two diggers, are posted 12 feet from the
cutting line of the ditch. They pass the earth back
toward the interior crest and the traverse, keeping the
top surface nearly level.</p>

<p><i>The gun-portion party</i> is divided up equally among
the gun portions, each digger is allotted a task 4' wide,
7' 6" long, and 3' 6" deep. The gabions around the
gun portion are placed by the shovellers under the
direction of the engineer soldiers, a short one being
placed at the throat of the embrasure. The shovellers
spread and level the earth thrown out by the gun-portion
parties and the rear-trench party. They work in
connection with the other shovellers to give to the
traverses and parapet near the interior crest the proper
shape.</p>

<p><i>The Rear-trench Party.</i>&mdash;This party excavates to a
width of 7' 6" the rear trench and the communications
with the parallel or approach. Each digger has a task
4' wide, 7' 6" long, and 3' 6" deep. The two directly
in rear of each gun portion throw the earth to the rear,
the others throw it to the front, leaving a berm of 4' 6"
at the rear of the traverse. The men of the <i>reserve</i>
who are not otherwise occupied fill sand-bags from the
earth thrown to the rear, and cut a ramp 8 feet wide
and not steeper than ¼, in rear of each gun-portion,
when needed. It is essential that the excavation of
the gun-portion be finished by the first relief, so that
the platforms may be laid by the second relief in time
to allow the guns to be placed before daylight.</p>

<p>The first relief leaves in the battery the tools required
by the second and carries the rest back to the depot.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span></p>

<p><i>The second relief</i> is divided into three parties and a
strong reserve of one quarter or one fifth of its strength.
The first, or <i>front-ditch party</i>, works in the front ditch,
widening it 6 feet and throwing the earth back to form
the front of the parapet. The shovellers, one to each
two diggers, spread and level it. The task of a digger
is 5' wide, 6' long, and 3' 6" deep.</p>

<p>The second, or <i>platform party</i>, places the platforms
and gives way to the gun detachments.</p>

<p>The third, or <i>rear-trench party</i>, widens the trench 3'
towards the front by cutting off the rear of the traverses.</p>

<p>The <i>reserve</i> completes any work left unfinished by
the first relief, fills sand-bags and places them around
the gun portions, digs ditches and drainage-pits when
needed, and does any other work necessary for the
completion and arming of the battery.</p>

<p>When a tramway is laid in the trench for bringing up
the guns and carriages, the ramps in rear need not be cut.</p>

<p id="I_art51"><b>51.</b> <b>Alternative Construction in Position Very
Much Exposed.</b>&mdash;When the earth thrown up in making
the splinter-proofs cannot be concealed, it may
attract such a severe fire from the defence as to make
the above-described construction impossible. In this
case the battery is traced as above described, the balks
for covering the splinter-proofs are placed in position
resting on bearing-planks, and the construction of the
front ditch, gun portions, and rear trench are commenced
at once; and the battery is as nearly finished
as time allows, and armed if possible. The splinter-proofs
are subsequently mined out and the remaining
necessary details finished before opening fire.</p>

<p id="I_art52"><b>52.</b> <b>Splinter-proofs</b>, in addition to those in the central
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
trench, are usually constructed under the rear of
the traverses (<a href="#pl_06">Pl. VI</a>, Figs. 65-67). These may be
made during the construction of the battery or after
its completion. They are about 5 feet wide, 6 feet
deep, and 10 feet shorter than the width of the traverse.
Their floor is at 6 feet below the surface. The
earth is held up by frames and sheeting, and the roof
is supported by cross-balks resting on posts and running
back into the traverse. The roof consists of railroad
iron or heavy timbers covered with earth, and access is
given by steps from the rear trench; the space not
occupied by the steps may be shielded with inclined
posts or other covering if thought necessary. These
splinter-proofs differ in no essential from those described
in Field Fortifications. The finished battery
is shown in <a href="#pl_06">Pl. VI</a>, Figs. 62-64.</p>

<p id="I_art53"><b>53.</b> <b>Sunken Battery in a Parallel</b> (<a href="#pl_07">Pl. VII</a>, Figs.
68 and 69).&mdash;A battery similar to the one above described
is sometimes constructed in a parallel. In this
case the traverses have to be built up, and therefore
do not usually exceed 20 feet in thickness. Pickets
are driven at intervals of 35 feet along the banquette
of the parallel to mark the centres of the gun spaces,
and the rest of the battery is traced in the usual way.
The steps of the parallel are cut away and the slope
revetted for the gun spaces and the central trench.
Gabions are placed along the back of the central trench
and the sides of the traverses. A rear trench 7' 6"
wide is cut from the parallel at an easy curve, so that
its front cutting-line shall be 25 feet from the foot of
the interior slope; this, as before, is widened 3 feet by
the second relief cutting away the rear of the traverses.
The reverse slope of the parallel in rear of the gun
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
portions is cut back to the rear trench. A trench 2
feet wide and 2 feet deep is cut between the front of
the traverses and the foot of the interior slope, and the
cartridge recesses are excavated. The gabions of the
traverses are filled, balks placed over the central
trench, and the tops of the traverses and splinter-proofs
are raised to the height of the parapet of the
parallel. A ditch in the front of the parallel 12'
wide and 3' 6" deep, traced at dusk, and excavated
during the night, supplies earth to make the parapet
30' thick and 4' 6" high. The work done in and behind
the parallel is not seen from the front, hence a
great part of it may be done by day, undetected by the
enemy. The upper part of the traverses is made by
night, and the front ditch and front of the parapet are
made the same night or subsequently, depending upon
the number of workmen available.</p>

<p>Since the gabions of the traverses seriously obstruct
the parallel, they should not be placed in position until
all arrangements are made to open the rear trench.</p>

<p>In the special case of a battery on the crowning of
the covered way, the traverses have been already constructed
in running the sap. The splinter-proofs may
be constructed by blinding portions of the sap, or by
mining them under the traverses. Owing to the height
of the parapet, embrasures of some depth will have to
be cut through it. This is done by a shallow sap
started by one man, who is subsequently assisted by a
second, if the splay requires it. The cheeks are revetted
with sand-bags, covered with hides. The mouth
of the embrasure is left closed with the head parapet of
the sap until fire is to be opened, when the earth is
dug away or blown away by the gun.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span></p>

<p id="I_art54"><b>54.</b> <b>Battery Behind the Crest of a Hill</b> (<a href="#pl_05">Pl. V</a>,
Figs. 57-59).&mdash;In a battery behind the crest of a hill
the front ditch may be omitted, the gun-portions may
be entirely in excavation, and the platforms given such
a reference as to require a shallow groove to be cut
through the crest to allow the gun to fire. When the
ground falls away very rapidly to the rear it may be
stepped under the traverses to prevent their sliding,
and the rear of the gun emplacement may be raised
when necessary to give the platform the proper slope.
The central trench is cut deep enough to give 5 feet of
cover over the splinter-proofs.</p>

<p id="I_art55"><b>55.</b> <b>Batteries on Sloping Ground</b> (<a href="#pl_07">Pl. VII</a>, Figs.
70-72).&mdash;When the ground to be occupied by the battery
slopes towards or from the place or falls off on
either side, the battery is constructed essentially as
upon level ground. The central passage is driven, following
the surface of the ground, the gun emplacements,
front and rear trench are excavated as before
described, the additional excavation or filling required
in each gun emplacement to make the platform horizontal
is regulated for the particular site, any excess of
earth being used to give greater cover on the more
exposed side, and any deficiency being supplied from
the front or rear trench, as may be most convenient.
Where the extra work imposed by the slope is considerable,
a third relief may be required to finish the battery,
and its arming may be necessarily postponed
until the next night.</p>

<p id="I_art56"><b>56.</b> <b>Embrasures.</b>&mdash;Modern siege guns are generally
mounted either on “overbank” or “disappearing”
carriages, firing over parapets of sufficient height to
give cover to the men. (The axis of the trunnions of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
the U. S. 5" siege gun is 6" above the platform.) Embrasures
when used are generally shallow grooves cut in
the top of the parapet. In this case the bottom of
these grooves must cut the surface of the top of the
parapet at or in rear of the highest line visible to the
enemy, so that no indentations which can be seen by
him will indicate the position of the guns. To effect
this, the exterior crest will usually be as high as and
sometimes higher than the interior crest, and the top
of the parapet (“superior slope”) will be level or will
slope to the rear. In rare instances, however, deeper
embrasures with revetted cheeks must be made. The
only serviceable revetment for use with high-power
guns is one of sand-bags wrapped in raw hides. This
may be made by laying down a hide, piling a number of
sand-bags upon it, and folding the free end back over
them; placing another hide on top of this with more
sand-bags and so on. Or large packages may be made
by wrapping up a number of sand-bags in each hide and
these packages may be used for making the revetment.</p>

<p>The embrasure should be bottle-shaped in plan,
shaped like a segment of an ellipsoid immediately in
front of the muzzle of the gun, then drawn in like the
neck of a bottle and narrowed to as small a mouth as
possible, so as to diminish the effect of the blast and
give the least possible exposure to the gun. When
the battery is exposed to slant or enfilading fire, instead
of embrasures, bonnets of sand-bags may be built
upon the parapets to protect the guns.</p>

<p id="I_art57"><b>57.</b> <b>Observatories.</b>&mdash;Observatories or look-outs, as
previously stated, should as a rule be placed on high
points well on the flanks of the battery.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> When this is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
impracticable, they may be made by building up at the
rear of the traverses, on the flanks, or even in the gun
portions, glacis-shaped covers pierced with a sight-hole
in all respects similar to a loop-hole for musketry, and
with just sufficient splay to include the desired field of
view. A number of these should be provided for each
battery, so that the enemy may not know which one
is in use at any time. If subject to close and accurate
fire, the crest-line in their vicinity must be of the same
level as the tops of the look-outs, and provision must
be made to prevent the light showing through them.</p>

<p id="I_art58"><b>58.</b> <b>Drainage.</b>&mdash;After the completion and arming of
the battery, gutters should be cut on each side of the
gun-portion leading into one running along the reverse
of the rear trench which carries the water to low ground
on the exterior, or which is provided with dry wells or
drainage-pits for collecting the water so that it may
soak into the ground or be pumped out with hand-pumps.</p>

<p id="I_art59"><b>59.</b> <b>Mortar Batteries.</b>&mdash;The introduction of rifled
mortars of all calibres, with the corresponding increase
in accuracy of fire, together with the destructive effects
of shells charged with high explosives, will doubtless
lead to the extensive use of mortars in future sieges.</p>

<p>In a distant attack the requirements of a mortar
battery are very simple, consisting principally of a stable
platform, magazines for ammunition, and bomb-proof
covers for the gunners; since the battery as a
rule will be concealed from the view of the work by
intervening obstacles, and will in consequence not be
subject to direct fire. When the soil is favorable, cover
against plunging fire will be most easily obtained by
sinking pits for the mortars to such depth as may be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
necessary to furnish earth for a splinter-proof parapet
surrounding the pit, and for cover for the bomb-proof
shelters for the men and the magazines.</p>

<p>When ample space exists which is well concealed,
and in which the soil is good, a separate emplacement
should be made for each mortar. When necessary,
however, two or more mortars may be placed in each
pit. The magazines, splinter and bomb proofs are
similar to those elsewhere described. When no natural
mask exists, the battery may be constructed behind
an artificial screen, and be made of the general type
of the “exposed siege battery,” the gun portions being
made with front enough to accommodate one or two
mortars as may be preferred, and of such length only
as is needed for working the mortar employed. The
terre-plein may be placed at any convenient depth below
the surface of the ground, and the revetment of
the interior slope, if any be used, will not ordinarily be
carried higher than the muzzle of the mortar. As the
traverses are not subject to gun-fire, the splinter-proofs
afforded by the central passage may be added to by
building others along both sides of the traverse; and
by deepening the mortar emplacement sufficiently, they
may be given enough cover to make them true bomb-proofs.</p>

<p>A mortar battery fulfilling these conditions can
hardly be silenced by hostile fire.</p>

<p>The conditions under which the batteries may be
constructed are, however, so varied that detailed dimensions
will not be given. No difficulty will exist in
making the battery of a size suitable for the pieces to
be employed.</p>

<p>The U. S. rifled siege mortar is of 7-inch calibre, about
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
5 feet long, weighs 1715 lbs., and is designed to throw a
125-lb. shell with a charge of 5½ lbs. of powder, giving an
initial velocity of 685 f.s. and a range of about 4000 yards.
With reduced charges the range may be reduced to
about 650 yards without undue sacrifice of accuracy.</p>

<p>In the closer attack upon the work, batteries for the
smaller siege and field mortars may be readily constructed
in front or rear of the parallels, or in the parallels
or approaches themselves; splinter-proofs and
temporary magazines being constructed by methods
previously indicated. In many cases, however, the
lighter mortars, field and Coehorn, which do not require
fixed platforms, may be placed behind any part
of the trenches affording cover, and fire be opened and
continued until the fire of the enemy becomes too
annoying, when the mortars may be removed to some
other locality.</p>

<h3 id="MAGAZINES">MAGAZINES.</h3>

<p id="I_art60"><b>60.</b> <b>Magazines</b> should be provided, at least two to
each battery, not only to localize the injury due to an
explosion, but also to prevent the battery being disabled
by the explosion of a single one.</p>

<p>As previously stated (par. 43), they should contain
24 hours' supply (from 150 to 200 rounds) for each
gun which they are designed to serve,<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> which may
require a capacity in a single magazine of as much as
6,000 lbs. of powder.</p>

<p>This amount should be reduced when possible by
increasing the number of magazines. The cartridges
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
should be made up and packed in boxes at the depots
or parks, and the powder chambers in the magazines
should be of such size as to store these boxes with
only such vacant space as is necessary for ease in handling
them.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a></p>

<p id="I_art61"><b>61.</b> <b>Cover.</b>&mdash;The chamber should be covered with
strong balks or rails and enough earth to form a sloping
roof; over this raw hides or tarpaulin should be
spread, and the remainder of the earth filling be
spread upon this and rammed solidly. The amount
of earth cover required for security must be determined
from the principles given in par. 21. The
English engineers recommend as sufficient protection
against ordinary fire for a magazine 5 feet wide, two
layers of 9" × 9" fir laid crossing each other, or one
layer of 12" × 12" oak, covered with 5 feet of earth.</p>

<p>In experiments at Lydd in 1883, however, an 8-inch
howitzer shell falling at an angle of about 30° penetrated
through a covering of 7 feet of soft clay and burst
upon the timber roof of a magazine, cutting it through.
This shows that complete protection is not always
possible, and that the chances of hitting must be
reduced by making the horizontal area of the magazine
chamber as small as possible, and placing its
smaller dimension in the line of the hostile fire. The
clear height of the magazine should be 4' 6" to 5' minimum,
when practicable, and the top of the covering
balks should be at or below the level of the ground.</p>

<p id="I_art62"><b>62.</b> <b>Location.</b>&mdash;A magazine should be located at
such distance from the battery that its explosion will
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
not disable the guns, injure the parapets or traverses,
or seriously endanger the cannoneers;<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> but, on the
other hand, it should be near enough to allow the
ammunition boxes to be conveniently carried to the
cartridge recesses; and the communications for this
purpose should be well covered from hostile fire. The
entrance to the magazine should be so protected that
splinters cannot enter the chamber. Any natural
hollows, banks, etc., in the immediate vicinity of the
battery should be taken advantage of to facilitate the
construction of and give better cover to the magazines.
When nothing of this kind exists the magazines may
be placed on the flanks or in rear of the battery, and
should be masked and screened by the parapet of the
parallel, approach, communications, or battery, or by
special glacis-shaped screens made, for the purpose;
which should be much longer than the width of the
magazines that they cover, so that the discovery of the
location of the latter by the enemy may be made more
difficult. The magazines should not be located in rear
of the centre of the screens nor symmetrically with
reference to the battery, nor, when it can be avoided,
directly in rear of a gun. The passages leading to
them should enter the battery in rear of a flank or a
traverse, and should be so directed as to escape enfilade.
They should be so graded that the surface
water will run away from the door of the magazine
and be discharged upon lower ground or received in
drainage-pits placed at the lowest points.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span></p>

<p id="I_art63"><b>63.</b> <b>Construction of a Magazine Subject to
Direct Fire Only</b> (<a href="#pl_07">Pl. VII</a>, Figs. 73-77.)&mdash;The
method of tracing the magazine and its approaches is
too evident to need description. In this example an
earth cover of 5 feet against vertical and 20 feet against
horizontal fire is given. Should more or less be
desired, a corresponding change may be made in the
plan, depth of excavation, and depth and width of
approaches; and the earth for additional cover may
be obtained from a ditch or pit in rear of the magazine.
The excavation for the chamber is given a
width of 6', a depth of 5' 6", and a length of 12', the
entrance a width of 3', a depth of 5' 6", and a length
of 6'.</p>

<p>The sides of the chamber and entrance are held up
by frames 4' 9" high and 2' 11" wide, outside measurement.
The caps are 6" × 5", stanchions 4" × 5", and
the ground sills 3" × 5"; sheeting 1" thick is inserted
between the frames and the earth. The covering
balks are 9" × 6" and 10 feet long; their tops are flush
with the surface of the ground; cleats nailed on their
under side keep the tops of the side frames from being
pushed in by the pressure of the earth. The earth
cover is 5 feet high at the centre and 4 feet at the
crest of the outer slope. The passages are 5' 6" deep,
3' wide at bottom, and 5' at the top. The entrance is
blinded by placing balks across the passage for such
part of its length as may be thought necessary, and
extending the earth covering over them, as shown in
the section (Fig. 75). A door, swinging outside, is
hung on the outside frame. Heavy railroad iron may
be substituted for the timber balks with advantage.
When thicker balks are used, or when a second layer is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
added, the chamber and passage should be correspondingly
deepened.</p>

<p id="I_art64"><b>64.</b> <b>Manner of Executing the Work.</b>&mdash;The powder
chamber and passage are excavated and the frames
and balks placed during the first night, while the central
passage of the battery is being constructed. The
excavated earth is thrown out far enough to allow the
balks to be put in position, and is so spread as not to
be seen by the defence. This may be done by one
relief of 8 hours, or two reliefs of 4 hours each. If the
work is not completed during the night, the sheeting,
frames, and balks may be placed by day under cover of
the earth thrown out and the existing screens.</p>

<p>The passages are excavated and the earth cover completed
on the second night by two 4-hour reliefs, the
first excavating to a depth of 3' 6", and the second to
5' 6", trimming up the slopes and completing the work.
When necessary, the sides of the passage will be revetted
by the second and a third relief.</p>

<p>When the necessity for great haste exists, the excavation
of the powder-chamber, entrance, and passages
may be carried on at the same time, the excavated
earth being thrown in front and on the sides of the
powder-chamber until the balks are in position, and
then thrown back upon them, levelled and rammed.</p>

<p id="I_art65"><b>65.</b> <b>Mined Magazine.</b>&mdash;When the soil, by absence
of rock and water, admits of mining, greater cover
against vertical fire can be obtained with less work by
mining out the powder-chamber and passages (<a href="#pl_08">Pl.
VIII</a>, Figs. 78, 79). The figures illustrate one of
minimum dimensions, which is constructed as follows:
The entrance 10' × 5' by 5' 6" deep is first excavated,
revetted with frames and sheeting and covered with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
balks and earth as indicated. At 1 foot from the end a
shaft 2' × 5' is sunk to a depth of 12'. From the front
of this a gallery 2' × 5' 6" is driven for about 6'; at the
end of this galleries 5' 6" × 2' are broken out on each
side and driven so far as may be necessary to store the
requisite number of ammunition-boxes. (For method of
sinking shafts, driving galleries, etc., see Military Mining,
<a href="#II_art25">Arts. 25</a>, <a href="#II_art33">33</a>, and <a href="#II_art44">44</a>-48.) The excavated earth is
spread on top of the magazine to increase the thickness
of the cover already given by that excavated from the
passages. A ring-bolt is placed in the balk directly
over the shaft, for attaching a hoisting tackle for removing
the earth during construction and for hoisting
and lowering ammunition-boxes afterward.</p>

<p>A door opening outward may be hung at the entrance,
and the passage may be blinded as previously
described, if it is thought necessary. The communications
are arranged in essentially the same way as for
the magazine previously described.</p>

<p>The dimensions given are the least which will allow
moderately free access and good cover. The magazine
should be constructed, by good miners, in two nights
and the intervening day, and will store about 4000
pounds of cartridges in boxes. When time and the
character of the ground admit, and larger capacity is
desired, the shaft may be made wider and deeper, the
gallery wider and longer, and the powder-chamber
deeper, longer, and wider, if desired.</p>

<p>The excavation for the entrance and approaches,
the placing of balks, and the levelling and ramming of
the earth-cover, should be done by night; the mining
work can be carried on both night and day.</p>

<p id="I_art66"><b>66.</b> <b>Elevated Magazines.</b>&mdash;When the presence of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
rock or water in the soil prevents sinking the magazines
to the full depth above given, they must be sunk
so far as practicable and given the least possible clear
height of powder chamber, with the best attainable
overhead cover. This should be strengthened by the
use of railroad iron or rolled iron beams, when available.
The cover against direct fire should be increased
up to 30 feet, and the front slope be made gentle, like
a glacis. A screen made of an earthen bank with a
glacis slope should also be used if possible. These
precautions having been taken, the depth of the powder-chamber
in the direction of the hostile fire should
be reduced to a minimum, and the storage of large
quantities of powder be avoided, so far as possible, by
constructing a number of small magazines at the most
convenient places in the vicinity of the battery.</p>

<p id="I_art67"><b>67.</b> <b>Precautions against Dampness in Magazines
for Siege Batteries.</b>&mdash;Underground magazines
of the character above described are, of necessity,
sometimes damp. The only ventilation usually possible
is obtained by leaving the door open, the air
being changed more or less by the men going in and
out.</p>

<p>The passage leading to the powder-chamber should
enter it at the middle, and in the service of the guns
one half of the chamber should be emptied on one day
and the other half on the next. This will usually limit
the time which a cartridge is exposed to the dampness
of the magazine to a maximum of one or two days.

<span class="large">SIEGE OPERATIONS.</span></h2>

<h3 id="The_Attack_Successive_Steps">THE ATTACK.</h3>

<p id="I_art68"><b>68.</b> Siege operations include all the steps taken from
the first approach to the work up to its final capture.
These taken in regular order are as stated in Chapter II:
the <i>investment</i>, the <i>distant artillery attack</i>, the <i>construction
of approaches</i> and <i>parallels</i>, <i>breaching by artillery or
mines</i>, and the <i>final assault</i>.</p>

<p>For convenience in description the siege has been
divided into three periods. The <i>first period</i> includes
the preliminary operations up to the completion of the
investment.</p>

<p>The <i>second period</i> includes all the operations between
breaking ground for the batteries of the first artillery
position and the first parallel, up to the completion of
the most advanced parallel and the occupation of a
position near the foot of the glacis from which the attack
is to be made upon the breach, either by assault
or sap.</p>

<p>The <i>third period</i> comprises the advance from the
last parallel, and all subsequent operations up to the
capture of the last entrenchment and the surrender of
the garrison.</p>

<p>The first and second periods are sometimes known
as the “<i>distant</i>” and the third period as the “<i>close
attack</i>.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span></p>

<h3 id="The_First_Period">FIRST PERIOD.</h3>

<p id="I_art69"><b>69.</b> As a preliminary to the siege of any fortified
place, all possible information is obtained as to the
strength and character of its fortifications, the garrison,
armament, stores of provisions and ammunitions, water
supply, water routes, telegraph and railroad lines, manufactures,
especially those which may be converted into
factories of arms and munitions, the character of the
population of the place, their probable food supply and
their loyalty to their state; also the topographical features
and nature of the ground in the vicinity of the
work, the sites of camps and parks, the prevalent diseases
of the locality and the best means of preventing
their attacks, etc., etc. (see Bureau of Intelligence, Art
of War, par. 128).</p>

<p>From these data the necessary materials and supplies
are collected at convenient points, the railroad or water
routes selected, and the cars, boats, wagons, etc., for
their transportation provided; so that they may arrive
promptly and in the proper order when needed.</p>

<p id="I_art70"><b>70.</b> <b>The Investment.</b>&mdash;The investing force is
brought together, organized, and moved rapidly upon
the place. When it is available a large force of mounted
troops may be used advantageously in the investment,
and be subsequently relieved by infantry and artillery.</p>

<p>When the investment is made, it adds greatly to the
advantage of the attack to completely surround and
isolate the work, and to push the investing line as near
it as possible. When the investing force is more or
less dispersed, and is to be concentrated for the siege,
the temptation frequently exists to march them by
converging lines upon the place as a point of concentration.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span></p>

<p>While this may be advisable in some cases (as where
the garrison is very weak or under an inefficient commander),
it will usually expose the subdivisions of the
investing force to be beaten in detail (Art of War, par.
392). So also in surrounding the place; a premature
subdivision of the force into small fractions not protected
by field-works, or not within supporting distance
each other, will afford to an active defence an opportunity,
by well-conducted sorties, to inflict most
severe losses upon the attack and very greatly delay
the investment. Keeping these dangers in view, the
investing force will move rapidly upon the work, seize,
strengthen, and occupy strong points as near the work
as possible, and extend the lines to right and left as
rapidly as good judgment allows, until the place is surrounded.
Meanwhile detachments of greater or less
size will scour the ground around the place, seizing and
carrying off or destroying, so far as possible, all cattle,
grain, lumber, etc., and everything else which would be
of use to the attack or defence. Under cover of these
detachments and escorts specially detailed for the purpose,
reconnoissances will be made to cover so much
of the ground as can be reached, especial efforts being
made to examine the ground near the works. These
reconnoissances will necessarily be hurried and incomplete
but, must be as accurate as they can be made
under the circumstances. They should be directed
principally to determining the heights and directions
of the principal points of the works, and their positions
with reference to prominent points that may be used
as landmarks, in verifying and correcting maps and
information previously obtained, to discovering the
existing armament of the place and the steps already
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
taken for its defence, and to collecting all possible information
bearing upon the selection of the front of
attack.</p>

<p>Systematic reconnoissances and surveys carried on
throughout the siege must be relied upon for checking
and completing the work thus begun.</p>

<p>So soon as the supporting points for the investing
force are secured, a line of outposts is pushed forward
towards the work and sentinels, pickets, etc., are established
(Art of War, pars. 167-194). The lines of sentinels,
pickets, and supports are placed as near the work
as practicable, and the line of resistance is advanced at
every favorable opportunity.</p>

<p>The usual rules for posting and relieving the outposts,
establishing day and night cordons, the use of
patrols, etc., are applied, with such modifications as circumstances
render advantageous.</p>

<p>Any advanced points affording marked advantage to
the attack which have been seized are strengthened
and held when possible, even at considerable cost in
men or with some delay in completing the investment.</p>

<p id="I_art71"><b>71.</b> <b>Bringing up and Posting the Besieging Force.</b>&mdash;The
main besieging force, consisting principally of infantry,
artillery, and engineers, with the siege train, follows
closely after the investing force, and, upon arrival
is encamped upon sites previously selected, sending out
at once, however, such reinforcements and supports as
are needed by the line of investment. Engineer and
artillery parks are established outside the zone of fire
of the works and in proximity to the main routes of
communication. Branch railways and tram-roads running
through the parks, storehouses, repair shops, etc.
etc., are located and constructed. Sites for storage magazines
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
for ammunition are carefully selected at the most
secure places, and isolated when possible from the camps
and parks by intervening elevations of ground. The
cover of these magazines, so far as possible, is made up
of wood and sand or earth free from stones large enough
to be dangerous projectiles in case of explosion. Rooms
for loaded shells and cartridges, and laboratories for
making up ammunition are constructed upon similar
principles. Carefully studied arrangements for the
health and comfort of the men are made. Some of
these are outlined in Chapter VII.</p>

<p id="I_art72"><b>72.</b> <b>Fortifying the Camps, Parks, etc., etc.</b>&mdash;In
former sieges it was customary to completely surround
the ground occupied by the besieger with a continuous
line of works of simple trace and light profile called
the “<i>line of circumvallation</i>;” and to construct between
the camps and the work another line, either continuous
or with intervals, called the “<i>line of countervallation</i>.”
These lines were placed respectively at about 200 yards
in rear and in front of the camps.</p>

<p>The principal object of the first was to prevent by a
small force the entry of small reinforcing detachments
and supplies; that of the second was to resist vigorous
sorties by the defence, or sudden attacks from the outside
by strong reinforcing parties. For this purpose
the detached works of the line of countervallation were
so disposed as to cover the main depots, parks, roads,
etc., and to be in defensive relations with each other.</p>

<p>The great development of the line which must be
occupied by the besieger, owing to modern methods of
fortification and the range of rifled cannon, prohibits
the construction of complete lines of circum- and countervallation.
The besieger constructs in their stead one
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
or more lines of detached works upon advantageous
points, and covers the intervening ground more or less
thoroughly by patrols, outposts, etc. He then so disposes
his main force as to be able to concentrate enough
to meet any sorties of the defence; and, if necessary,
detaches a force, called an “<i>army of observation</i>,” sufficiently
large to meet any relieving army and defeat it;
or hold it in check until he can concentrate the besieging
force with the army of observation, and meet the
relieving army in a favorable position. As a rule, this
position will be one well outside the besieger’s cordon
of works; since the latter by its extent will necessarily
be weak to resist a determined attack (Art of War, par.
258), and by its proximity to the work will render possible
the co-operation of the garrison and the relieving
army. This, under the circumstances assumed, would
seriously endanger the besieging army.</p>

<p>In opposing sorties from the work, however, the conditions
which fix the point of conflict are reversed, and
place it as near the work as practicable. The shortening
and strengthening of the line of investment by
closing it in upon the work make it imperative to hold
all ground gained; and this is generally best accomplished
by intrenching the line of outposts with continuous
shelter trenches, strengthened at intervals by batteries
of field guns, and supported by field works of
considerable strength, placed within accurate cannon
range of each other, but not exposed to the direct fire
of the guns of the place. Behind the shelter trenches
the outposts, supports, and reserves, strengthened when
necessary by troops from other points of the line, should
be able to hold their own against all ordinary sorties.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
The main line of field works serves to resist a general
attack made by the mass of the garrison.</p>

<p>Placing the first intrenchments further back exposes
the outposts to the confusion resulting from falling
back, frequently at night or in a fog, and also enables
the besieged to seize upon ground from which it may
be very difficult to dislodge them.</p>

<p>To allow the different parts of the line to be rapidly
reinforced, good roads protected from the fire of the
work, and well marked with sign-posts, etc., must be
opened between the adjacent divisions of the besieging
force, and all streams must be provided with bridges
secure against floods, ice, etc.</p>

<p id="I_art73"><b>73.</b> <b>Distance of the Line of Investment from the
Work.</b>&mdash;This will result from conflicting conditions.
Reasons already given, which need not be repeated,
lead to establishing it as near as practicable. On the
other hand, the accurate fire of the heavy guns of the
place, and vigorous sorties by the defence, cause much
annoyance and great loss to a line drawn too near the
work. The more recent sieges indicate about 3000 yards
from the most advanced works, as the least distance
for the line of investment in open country and with an
active defence. It may be necessary in some cases to
increase this to 4500 or 5000 yards; but with ground
favorable to the attack, and a weak and demoralized
defence, it may frequently be drawn nearer.</p>

<p id="I_art74"><b>74.</b> <b>Strength and Composition of the Besieging
Force.</b>&mdash;In former sieges when the place held out until
the inner keep was breached and carried by the regular
progress of the siege, the ratio of the necessary strength
of the attack to the defence was estimated at 7 or 8 to
1, this large ratio resulting from the excessive labor in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
the trenches and the losses incurred on the close attack.
Modern writers (arguing largely upon theoretical considerations)
have reduced this estimate to 4 or 5 to 1.
No attack on a thoroughly-equipped and well-defended
strong place having been carried through all the steps
of a regular siege since the introduction of modern
arms, absolute data upon this subject are lacking.</p>

<p>The besieging force at Strasburg was about 60,000,
garrison about 20,000, total length of siege 49 days.
The defence was very weak. Belfort, besieging force
about 32,000, garrison about 16,000. After a siege of
100 days the approaches were at about 1200 yards
from the works, which capitulated by reason of the
general surrender of the French. At Metz the besieging
force was 150,000 men; the garrison, demoralized by
the previous defeat at Gravelotte, surrendered 173,000
men. At Paris the investing force was about 180,000,
and the garrison nominally between 300,000 and 400,000,
of which perhaps 30,000 were disciplined and
effective soldiers; the remainder being made up of
remnants of defeated regiments and bodies of the
Garde Mobile and Garde Nationale. The investment
of Paris was complete on September 19, 1870; its surrender
from exhaustion of provisions took place January
29, 1871. Several sorties were made, but the general
defence was paralyzed by the character of the troops
and inhabitants. At Plevna the Turks had at the outset
about 56,000 men, at the surrender 40,000. The
Russian force suffered great losses in its assaults, but
by continual reinforcement had at the end of the siege
about 120,000 men. The defence by the Turks was
desperate, but generally passive. One determined sortie
was made immediately before the surrender. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
surrender resulted from exhaustion of ammunition and
provisions. The works were field works only.</p>

<p>At Belfort the investing force was at first but 10,000
and the line of investment 25 miles long, giving but
400 men to the mile. This force was subsequently
increased to 20,000 men, and when the besieging army
had all arrived, to 32,000 men.</p>

<p>At Paris (1870) the line of investment was about 3
miles from the line of the forts, and about 53 miles in
length, the investing force 180,000, giving a mean of
about 2 men to the yard. The distribution was, however,
about 4 to the yard on the left bank and 1⅓ on the
right bank of the Seine.</p>

<p>At Plevna the line of investment was 2¾ miles from
the forts, its length 43½ miles, the investing force 100,000
men, about 1¼ men to the yard.</p>

<p>In each of these sieges the place finally fell under the
attack of a force, in no case equal to 2½ times the garrison;
but inferences drawn from this fact are apt to be
erroneous, since none of these places was well fortified
according to modern methods, well garrisoned, well
supplied, and defended to extremity.</p>

<p>The results show, however, that under similar circumstances,
which are apt to arise in any modern war, the
attack of a strong place which can be completely invested
by a force of two or three times the strength of
the garrison, may promise success; which seems to be
assured if the defence allows the besieging force to
complete the investment and thoroughly intrench itself.</p>

<p>On the other hand, tactical considerations would indicate
that a well-equipped army, of good morale, under
an active and aggressive commander, covered by a modern
intrenched camp, should be able to prevent the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
investment; and by taking advantage of its interior
lines, its heavy guns and its strong <i>points d’appui</i>, should
be able to beat in detail a force very much greater than
itself whose fractions, by reason of the extent of the
line of investment, are necessarily not within supporting
distance of each other.</p>

<p>These advantages of the defence evidently disappear,
as above indicated, when the attack is allowed to complete
its fortifications, since under their cover a small
force can check even a determined sortie until a sufficient
force to beat it can be concentrated.</p>

<p>From these considerations it is evident that an investment,
once completed, may be maintained by a force
less than that necessary to establish it in the first place
(see Investment of Plevna, Pierron, Méthodes de Guerre
Vol. III, pp. 647 <i>et seq.</i>).</p>

<p id="I_art75"><b>75.</b> <b>The Point of Attack.</b>&mdash;From the information
originally in possession of the besieger, supplemented
by that obtained by reconnoissance, a decision is made
as to the fronts of the work or the particular detached
works of the intrenched camp upon which the approaches
are to be made. The portion selected in either
case is called the “<i>point of attack</i>.” To reduce an intrenched
camp, it will in general be necessary to capture
at least two of the detached works and to silence
the artillery fire of one or more on each side of those
taken. In an attack upon a strongly-fortified enceinte,
the least that is usually undertaken is to breach and
capture one front with its adjacent outworks, and to
silence the fire of those which enfilade the approaches
and parallels or take them in reverse.</p>

<p>In selecting the point of attack the first consideration
is, that when taken, it shall afford material advantage
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
to the besieger and give him a foothold from which
further approaches may be driven, if necessary. This
condition being fulfilled, the choice will result from a
careful study of the nature of the works and site.
Those forts or fronts resting upon precipices, bordering
deep marshes or deep and rapid streams, or which are
so placed that approaches upon them will be swept in
flank and rear by the fire of the works, which cannot be
silenced, are considered impregnable by the ordinary
operations of the siege. Most serious difficulties are
presented by those in which the adjacent works are so
disposed and of such strength that they can be carried
only in succession and by regular approaches; those
provided with wet ditches in which strong currents can
be produced, those with dry deep ditches, those which
are mined, and those which present long lines nearly
straight, or even concave to the attack, and covering a
front nearly equal or even greater than can be occupied
by the trenches of the besiegers.</p>

<p>When the parallels and approaches have to be constructed
upon ground sloping downward towards the
work, in soil containing large stones, or in which the
rock is close to the surface, in marshy ground or that
containing much water or liable to be flooded, the difficulty
of their construction and defilade are evident.
The point of attack considered most favorable to the
besieger is one which, fulfilling the first essential condition,
is more or less salient, so that it can be partially
surrounded, and which admits of the approaches being
driven toward it in favorable soil, over ground sloping
gently from the work, or gently rolling with the crests
and valleys of sufficient difference of level to afford
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
cover, and running generally in the direction of the
parallels.</p>

<p>A favorable location for parks, etc., with free, safe,
and short communications between them, also has great
weight in selecting the point of attack.</p>

<h3 id="SECOND_PERIOD">SECOND PERIOD.</h3>

<p id="I_art76"><b>76.</b> <b>First Artillery Position.</b>&mdash;Every siege begins
with a bombardment, which is designed, as previously
stated, to drive in the outlying posts of the defence, to
silence, so far as possible, the artillery annoy and wear
out the garrisons of the works to be attacked, to interrupt
the communications between them, break up
bomb and splinter proofs, destroy magazines and
depots, and, if the enceinte can be reached by the artillery,
to bring a fire upon the population which will lead
to or hasten the surrender of the place.</p>

<p>The considerations which determine the location of
the batteries for the general bombardment have already
been given (par. 7), as well as the construction of the
batteries and screens used (Chap. IV.). For the systematic
attack, however, the necessity of dismounting or
silencing the guns bearing upon the proposed approaches
introduces the additional condition that the
batteries should be so located that besides their general
effect each shall fulfil, so far as practicable, its special
design by bringing an enfilading or reverse fire upon
certain fronts; or, in connection with other batteries,
shall keep down the fire of certain fronts by a preponderance
of direct fire. Many batteries which fulfil
these last conditions occupy their original positions
during the entire siege. The requisite concentration of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
fire upon the point of attack and its careful regulation
for the special object in view will frequently restrict
the arc occupied by the batteries below that desirable
for a general bombardment only; and will necessitate
a closer grouping of the batteries for their easier control
by the artillery commanders. This line of batteries
first established is known as the “<i>first artillery position</i>”
(<a href="#pl_08">Pl. VIII</a>, Figs. 80, 81). As the batteries must be secure
against the attacks of the defence, they must of
necessity be outside the besiegers defensive line. Their
distance in yards will result from the character of the
defence and may vary from 2000 or 2500 yards for a
weak defence, to 3500 or 4500 yards for an active one.
On account of their long range and the object to be
obtained by their fire, they are armed with the heaviest
rifles and howitzers available, supplemented with rifled
mortars of as large calibre as can be obtained, firing, if
practicable, torpedo shells charged with high explosives.</p>

<p>Batteries of field guns which have already been favorably
located for the defence of the heavier batteries
against attack, or for firing upon the more advanced
works, may, by modification of their gun pits into finished
batteries (par. 44), be used in conjunction with
the heavy batteries of the first artillery position.</p>

<p>The total number of guns employed should be such
as to give to the attack a marked superiority over the
defence at the opening of the bombardment.</p>

<p id="I_art77"><b>77.</b> <b>Opening Fire.</b>&mdash;The batteries having been completed
and armed, the magazines finished and supplied,
and the parks, depots and communications put in such
order that the batteries can be kept fully supplied with
ammunition; the fire of the batteries is commenced
simultaneously, the signal being given by a gun from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
some selected battery. The fire once opened is continued
day and night during the siege, unless stopped
by the commanding officer or from inability to keep it
up. It usually begins at daylight, in order to enable
the ranges to be corrected by the first shots, before the
defence has accurately located the batteries unmasked
during the preceding night. To open fire from a few
batteries before the others are ready is inexcusable, as
it enables the defence to concentrate its fire upon them
and destroy them in succession. The targets of each
battery and gun and the rate of fire are prescribed before
the fire is opened, and these are changed only by
subsequent orders or from sudden emergencies. The
fire is as a rule deliberate, seldom exceeding an average
of 4 shots per hour for each gun by day, and 2 per hour
at night. This rate may be increased or diminished by
the commanding officer for special reasons and for a
limited time.</p>

<p>The fire of the batteries is directed upon all the
works of the place within range, but with greater vigor
upon the more important, and especially upon those
near the point of attack. The fire against powder-magazines
and storehouses should be uninterrupted, to
prevent the removal of powder and munitions. If the
artillery of a part of the work is silenced, the fire upon
it may be slackened, but some fire, especially vertical,
should be kept up.</p>

<p>At night the fire is directed against the larger targets,
such as communications and covers, rather than upon
the guns; but the fire against the interior of the place
(especially a city) is kept at about the same rate day
and night.</p>

<p>If preparations for a sortie are detected, the fire of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
the large pieces is directed at the points of assembly,
when known, and at the openings through which the
sortie is to be made. The field guns direct their fire
upon the troops in accordance with the tactical use of
this arm.</p>

<p>If the batteries of the first artillery position have
the proper preponderance over those of the place, they
should soon clear away the advanced posts, and keep
down the fire of the works so that the besieger may
advance his outposts, control the exterior ground and
prepare to open the first parallel and establish the
second artillery position.</p>

<p id="I_art78"><b>78.</b> <b>Plan of Attack.</b>&mdash;By this time the reconnoissances
and surveys should be so far advanced and so
thoroughly checked up that the chief engineer will have
been able to make, upon a large scale, a map of the
place and its surroundings with considerable accuracy,
and to locate upon it the proposed position of the first
and second parallels, the approaches, and the batteries
of the second artillery position. This map, with the
accompanying memoirs, makes up the “<i>plan of attack</i>,”
which, when approved by the commanding general,
serves as a working plan for the prosecution of the
siege, and is continually corrected and added to as the
siege progresses.</p>

<p>This map should be made in duplicate at least, and
for accuracy in the history of the siege should be corrected
so far as possible by redrawing or tracing, instead
of by erasures.</p>

<p id="I_art79"><b>79.</b> <b>The First Parallel.</b>&mdash;The first parallel (<a href="#pl_08">Pl.
VIII</a>, Figs. 80 and 81) serves as an intrenchment for
the troops who protect the second artillery position
and who cover the workmen driving the approaches.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
It also affords a covered communication between the
different lines of approaches.</p>

<p>Its length must be sufficient to cover all the batteries
of the second artillery position and protect their flanks;
it must therefore extend beyond the batteries which
enfilade those faces of the fronts attacked whose prolongations
fall furthest out. Its flanks are usually more
or less refused, and terminated by strong earthworks.
Emplacements for batteries of field guns are provided
at intervals to assist the infantry in repelling sorties.
When the length of the parallel is very great, it is
sometimes not continuous when first opened, but the
portions covering the groups of batteries are first made
and are subsequently connected. The ground between
them is protected, meanwhile, by a strong fire of small
arms, field and other guns. When communications
covered by natural screens do not exist between the
first parallel, the batteries of the first artillery position,
and the parks, approaches are constructed at the same
time as the parallel, in sufficient number to give free
passage to the troops, guns, and materials.</p>

<p>These approaches (<a href="#pl_08">Pl. VIII</a>, Figs. 80 and 81), as all
others (par. 13), are so directed as not to be enfiladed
by the fire of the work, and should be provided with
portable or other tramways and cars, passing switches
being placed in the returns where needed.</p>

<p><b>Its Distance from the Work.</b>&mdash;As a rule, it may be
stated that the first parallel is placed as near the work
as possible. Most of the batteries of the second artillery
position are from 100 to 300 yards in its rear, and
the shorter their range the more effective is their fire.
The small-arm fire from the first parallel may also be
an important feature in modern sieges; to make it so
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
requires the parallel to be located within 1500 yards of
the work, if possible. By placing the parallel as near
the work as possible, its length and that of the saps are
correspondingly reduced, the amount of work lessened,
and generally the fall of the place hastened. If an attempt
be made to place it too close to the work, however,
the working parties will be discovered; they will
be within reach of strong sorties, and of the deadly
fire of small arms and machine guns; in consequence
of which they may suffer very great losses, be driven
off, and the construction of the parallel prevented.
The minimum distance under the most favorable circumstances
is then about 600 to 700 yards. (This was
the distance prescribed in the day of smooth-bore guns,
and was adopted as recently as 1870 at the siege of
Strasburg.) In an open, level country it may not be
possible to place the first parallel at a distance from the
most advanced work of less than 1800 to 2000 yards.
When, however, it is necessary to establish the first
parallel at a very great distance, it will not, as a rule,
be made continuous, but in fractions covering approaches
which are driven forward. The first continuous
parallel is then built at from 1000 to 1200 yards
from the works, and behind this the second artillery
position is established.</p>

<p id="I_art80"><b>80.</b> <b>Opening the Parallel.</b>&mdash;The profile of the parallel
is one of those already given (<a href="#pl_01">Pl. I</a>, Figs. 7-13),
and it is traced and constructed as described (pars. 14,
18, and 19), by simple trench, flying sap, or full sap, as
may be most advantageous. In some cases, however,
it is constructed by enlarging the line of shelter
trenches already made by the outposts. To cover the
working parties while excavating the trench, when the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
parallel is near enough the work to be endangered by a
sortie, the outposts are advanced to about 300 yards in
front of the line, the pickets and supports are posted
respectively at about 100 and 200 yards in their rear,
and are covered by rifle pits and trenches made for this
purpose during the preceding nights. To conceal from
the defence, if possible, the proposed location of the
parallel, these trenches and pits are constructed by all
the outposts in front of their positions. The reserves
are held 800 to 1000 yards in rear of the flanks, and
the whole covering force should be equal to ½ or <sup>2</sup>/<sub>8</sub> the
garrison of the place if an active defence is looked for.</p>

<p>At daylight the trenches will be far enough advanced
to protect the covering force which will occupy
them. This force is from this time known as the
“<i>guard of the trenches</i>,” and is relieved usually every 24
hours, the time of relief being so chosen as not to interfere
with the working parties.</p>

<p>The working parties are, as previously indicated,
divided into reliefs of 4 or 8 hours.</p>

<p>For continuous work the besieging force should be
large enough to allow each man, after being one day
in the guard of the trenches and one day in the working
party, to have one day in camp.</p>

<p id="I_art81"><b>81.</b> <b>The Second Artillery Position.</b>&mdash;By the second
artillery position previously referred to is meant
the position occupied by the guns of the attack, placed
in batteries, accurately located for breaching, enfilading,
counter-battering or other specific duty. These
batteries are usually of the class described under the
head of “exposed sunken batteries” (Plates V, VI,
VII), and are constructed behind or in the parallels, as
explained in pars. 48 to 55. When behind a parallel
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
they should be, if possible, at least 150 yards from it in
order that the blast of the guns shall not interfere too
much with the occupants of the parallel.</p>

<p id="I_art82"><b>82.</b> <b>Counter-batteries</b>, designed to dismount guns or
destroy embrasures of earth or masonry at ranges
from 700 to 1000 yards by direct fire may well be
armed with 4½ or 5 inch rifles, since their projectiles
have sufficient energy for the desired result, and the
guns admit of a more rapid and long-continued fire
than do those of greater calibre. The batteries must
be so placed as to look through the embrasure attacked,
and the number of guns pitted against any battery
must considerably exceed that in the battery.</p>

<p>Counter-batteries designed to silence by direct fire
guns in turrets or behind shields must be armed
with guns of large calibre, mounted with the best
available cover, and must be aided by rapid fire guns
of moderate calibre, designed to disable the turret
guns either by embrasure shots or by oblique shots
penetrating the parts which project from the turret.</p>

<p id="I_art83"><b>83.</b> <b>Enfilading batteries</b> act in conjunction with
counter-batteries or independently; they are designed
to take the faces in flank or slightly in reverse, but are
of necessity at times limited to a slant fire. They are
located as nearly as possible in the prolongation of the
terre-pleins. When the salients are obtuse these prolongations
lie near the adjacent faces for some distance,
and consequently the only possible emplacements of
enfilading batteries will give ranges which may vary
from 1000 to 4000 yards. They are armed with cannon
of sufficiently large calibre to make their projectiles
efficient even at moderate velocities, and, when the
faces enfiladed are well provided with traverses, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
charges are reduced so as to give to the projectiles a
large angle of fall. When the batteries are on commanding
heights higher velocities may be used.</p>

<p id="I_art84"><b>84.</b> <b>Breaching batteries</b>, except those established
on the crest of the counterscarp, can only breach the
walls of modern forts by “curved” or “indirect” fire.
To obtain the necessary angle of fall with the requisite
accuracy and energy of blow, the guns must be of considerable
size and placed at comparatively long range;
the projectile must graze the crest of the glacis and
strike the scarp wall at an angle not too oblique. Experience
seems to indicate that the best effects are obtained,
all things considered, when the vertical plane of
fire makes an angle of from 55° to 60° with the face of
the scarp wall. The distance of the battery from the
wall to be breached is usually from 1000 to 1500 yards.</p>

<p>The same considerations govern the construction
and armament of batteries designed to destroy réduits,
barracks, gorge walls, city gates, magazines, depots,
bridges, locks, etc., etc.</p>

<p id="I_art85"><b>85.</b> <b>Batteries of rifled mortars or of howitzers
for vertical fire</b> should be so located, when possible,
that the longest dimension of the target will be
in the direction of their fire. The effect of their
projectiles is greatest when they can be fired at elevations,
of 60° to 70° and with large charges. These considerations,
combined with those of good cover and
easy supply, will govern their location.</p>

<p id="I_art86"><b>86.</b> <b>Opening and conduct of fire from Second
Artillery position.</b>&mdash;The batteries which are ready on
the morning of the completion of the parallel open fire
simultaneously upon the work, and are supported by
those of the first artillery position still armed. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
same rules govern the fire of the first and of the second
artillery position.</p>

<p>When the defence combines a number of batteries to
silence one of the attack a heavy fire is concentrated
upon these batteries by those from which the fire has
been diverted. New batteries unmasked by the defence,
or established in intermediate or other works, should
receive prompt attention from the attack, with a view
to silencing them if possible before they correct their
ranges. It is of the first importance that the superiority
of the artillery fire of the attack shall be established at
the opening of fire from the first artillery position and
be maintained throughout, and that the defence shall be
prevented from repairing any batteries which have been
silenced. To this end a few guns will keep up a slow
fire upon these batteries so long as it may be necessary.</p>

<p>Every gun of the defence must, if possible, be kept
under a heavy fire, and the fire upon the enceinte must
be opened at the earliest possible date and continued
day and night, as previously described.</p>

<p id="I_art87"><b>87.</b> <b>Musketry fire</b> will be opened as soon as a parallel
is established at such distance as to make it effective;
and this may be, for a well-regulated fire of
sharpshooters, at ranges of 1200 to 1500 yards, or in
some cases even greater.</p>

<p id="I_art88"><b>88.</b> <b>The Advance from the First Parallel.</b>&mdash;It is
assumed that the fire from the first and second artillery
positions will silence almost completely the artillery fire
of the work upon the fronts attacked; but the defence
will still be able to develop when necessary a strong
musketry fire, aided at times by machine and rapid-fire
or even some field guns. Consequently, the advance
from the parallel must be under cover.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span></p>

<p>Approaches are, therefore, broken out from the parallel
and pushed forward towards the work, the workmen
being protected by the fire of the guards of the
trenches. Usually at least three lines of approaches are
constructed, concentrating upon the point of attack and
following generally the lines of the capitals of the adjacent
salients.</p>

<p>When attacking a line of detached works two or more
lines of approaches may be constructed towards each
work attacked. The approaches are run in zigzags,
each branch so directed as to pass a short distance (30
or 40 yards) outside the most advanced work of the defence
from which it could be enfiladed; at each change
of direction of the zigzags a return of 10 or 20 yards is
made to cover the approach in rear (<a href="#pl_08">Pl. VIII</a>, Figs. 80
and 81). The length of the branches is so regulated as
not to mask too much of the front of the parallel; they
consequently grow shorter as they approach the work
and vary ordinarily between 200 and 50 yards, seldom
exceeding 100 yards when near the work. The heads
of the different approaches are advanced at about equal
speed so as to afford mutual support.</p>

<p id="I_art89"><b>89.</b> <b>The Second Parallel.</b>&mdash;The second parallel is
located nearer to the first parallel than to the covered
way, sometimes very much nearer. It is constructed
and occupied by the guard of the trenches. The
principle followed is that the guards of the trenches
shall always be nearer to the head of the sap than is the
enemy in his most advanced place of arms; so that, in
case of a sortie, the advantage will lie with the besieger.
The flanks of the second parallel are refused and strengthened
like those of the first, or are even carried back to
the first parallel, to guard them against flank attacks.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span></p>

<p>The second parallel having been completed and occupied,
serves as a base for further advance, which is conducted
according to the same methods, “<i>demi-parallels</i>”
(<a href="#pl_08">Pl. VIII</a>, Fig. 81) being run out to the right and
left of the approaches when they are well advanced beyond
the second parallel. These demi-parallels are
sometimes joined, forming a third parallel, from which
the approaches are advanced as before, with additional
parallels when needed, until the foot of the glacis or exterior
of the counter-mines is reached. The number of
parallels is determined by the distance at which the first
is established and the vigor of the defence; formerly
three were considered all that were needed, and this
number was used at Strasburg, 1870. At other modern
sieges a larger number has frequently been required.
At Belfort (1870-71) the third parallel was established
at 1200 yards from the place. Five parallels were used
at the siege of Fort Wagner (July-September, 1863).</p>

<p>The approaches are driven in zigzags by simple
trench, flying or full sap, until the direct advance becomes
equal to about one third of the length of trench;
and from this point they are driven directly upon the
work by double-traversed sap (<a href="#pl_03">Pl. III</a>, Figs. 28-35), the
latter being, as a rule, used only in advancing from the
foot of the glacis, or during the third period of the siege.</p>

<h3 id="THIRD_PERIOD">THIRD PERIOD.</h3>

<p id="I_art90"><b>90.</b> <b>The Third Period of the Siege</b> frequently
called the “<i>close attack</i>,” includes all the steps between
establishing the last parallel and the surrender
of the place. These are the capture and crowning
of the covered way, breaching the scarps and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
counter-scarps, passing the ditch, capturing and crowning
the breaches of the outworks and main works in
succession, and the final reduction of the interior retrenchments,
or keep.</p>

<p>All these operations are carried on within close and
deadly range of small arms and shells of Coehorn mortars,
and many of them within range of hand grenades
and upon ground honeycombed with mines and countermines,
or liable to be flooded or inundated. They are
slow in progress, uncertain in results, and require an
extravagant expenditure of men and material. They
can be pushed to a successful issue only when the
artillery fire of the place is silenced and its small-arm
fire is almost completely kept down by the fire of the
attack.</p>

<p>The conditions of modern warfare are such, however,
that by the time the attack has reached the foot of
the glacis the losses and exhaustion of the garrison
are frequently so great as to preclude an obstinate,
close defence; and, in the majority of cases, the place
is compelled to surrender before the close attack is
commenced.</p>

<p id="I_art91"><b>91.</b> <b>The capture and crowning of the covered
way</b> is accomplished by <i>assault</i> or by <i>sap</i>. The former
is an extremely hazardous and bloody operation,
which all authorities unite in condemning, and which
should be undertaken only in extreme cases. It is
carried out usually at night, by forming an assaulting
party in the parallel, who rush forward to the crest of
the covered way; capture, if possible, its guards, and
under any attainable cover open a fire upon the crest
of the work. All available small-arm and machine-gun
fire combines with this to keep down the fire of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
defence; and under cover of this fire the working parties
construct, by flying sap, a trench crowning the
covered way, and the communications between it and
the parallel.</p>

<p>The trench is occupied as soon as it affords cover,
and is subsequently completed and prepared for the
reception of its guns and infantry guard.</p>

<p>In crowning the covered way by sap (<a href="#pl_04">Pl. IV</a>, Fig.
36), the saps are broken out from the parallel, a circular
place of arms is constructed, which gives additional
communication and serves as a depot for trench materials,
the traversed sap is pushed forward, and the
covered way crowned as previously described (par. 36).
It will frequently be necessary to run out at right
angles to this sap short branches of parallels (<a href="#pl_09">Pl. IX</a>,
Fig. 83), to serve as places of arms, or as trenches of
departure for mines or galleries, for underground warfare
or for breaching walls.</p>

<p id="I_art92"><b>92.</b> <b>Breaching the Scarps and Counter-scarps.</b>&mdash;The
counter-scarp, as a rule, and the scarp at times
is breached by mining. (See Military Mining, pars.
91-93). When practicable, however, the scarp is
breached with artillery and preferably by guns of the
second artillery position; since a breaching battery on
the crowning of the covered way, which must be provided
with most ample splinter-proofs to protect the
gunners from flying splinters of masonry and shot, is
in general constructed only with great losses and delays;
and the guns in this position must be fired under
great angles of depression, requiring very deep embrasures
to avoid exposing the cannoneers. When the
ditch is deep and narrow it may be necessary to blow
down the counter scarp and part of the glacis, in order
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
to expose the scarp-wall to the fire of the breaching
battery, whether on the glacis or at a distance. This
necessity should be foreseen and provided for in locating
the batteries.</p>

<p>A full or semi-detached scarp-wall will be breached
when the battery is on the glacis by making vertical
cuts at the ends, and a horizontal cut at about one
third or one fourth its height from the bottom, and
then firing shells into the part to be brought down,
continuing the fire until the large masses of masonry
are broken up, and the slope is made gentle and smooth
enough to admit of easy ascent. A detached scarp-wall
will be breached by a glacis battery, or any scarp-wall
by a distant battery, by continued battering, which
will not only knock down the wall, but also break up
the fragments and make a practicable ramp.</p>

<p id="I_art93"><b>93.</b> <b>The Capture and Crowning of the Breach.</b>&mdash;The
decision as to whether the breach shall be
captured and crowned by <i>assault</i> or by <i>sap</i> will be governed
by considerations similar to those which determined
the character of the attack upon the covered way.
The difficulties and dangers of the assault are perhaps
greater than in that case. The <b>assault</b>, if undertaken,
will be carried out in a similar manner, previous
preparations having been made by making a practicable
breach at least 25 to 30 yards wide, a practicable
descent into the ditch of equal width, and a covered
place of assembly for the working party and a depot of
trench materials in immediate proximity to the breach.</p>

<p>The artillery defence of the ditch, whether from
caponières, flank embrasures or casemates, or from adjacent
works, must of course be silenced before crossing
the ditch either by assault or by regular approach.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
This is accomplished by counter-batteries on the glacis,
by heavy field guns located in temporary batteries
in the trenches, by mines, or by overhead or indirect
fire from the distant batteries, or from light mortars in
the advanced trenches, as may be necessary.</p>

<p>If the interior arrangement of the work is known by
the besieger the assault maybe made by night; but if it
is unknown, the confusion resulting from a night attack
will be so great as to render its success almost hopeless,
and the assault will have to be delivered by day.</p>

<p>The assaulting columns will be made up of an advanced
line of skirmishers (selected men, good shots,
and generally volunteers), followed by a working party
of sappers to clear away obstacles, these closely followed
by the columns of assault; while the supports
and reserves move forward in the trenches to join in the
assault as circumstances require. The troops who first
gain the crest establish themselves there and hold the
breach until those coming after them pass and engage
the garrison, while some detachments strive to capture
and open one gate or more to admit the reserves.
The assaulting force should be equal at least to once and
a half or twice the garrison, and simultaneous attacks
should be made upon other breaches or accessible parts
of the work to divide the attention of the defence.</p>

<p>These false attacks are sometimes successful, and
preparations for taking advantage of this contingency
should not be omitted. The subdivisions of the assaulting
force should each receive explicit instructions
as to its special object, and under no circumstances
should their lines of march intersect. Unmistakable
signals of recognition should be prescribed to prevent
conflicts arising between the different parties meeting
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
within the work. The bombardment preceding the
attack should not cease, and thus notify the defence
when the assault is to be made; but the guns should
be directed upon adjacent parts of the work until the
assault penetrates the work or is repulsed.</p>

<p id="I_art94"><b>94.</b> In the <b>attack by the sap</b> the method of crossing
the ditch adapted to the circumstances is used (pars.
39-41, <a href="#pl_04">Pl. IV</a>, Figs. 37-41) and the sap is started at
the foot of the breach, driven up it, and the breach is
crowned according to the methods previously described
(par. 36).</p>

<p>The sappers are protected from small sorties by the
fire from the crowning of the covered way and any
other points bearing on the head of the sap. Fireballs,
electric lights and other means will be used during
the night to light up the parapets of the work and
expose the defenders, in this as in the previous operations
of the siege. The crowning of the breach will be
extended and converted into a place of arms, from
which further sapping can be carried on in a similar
manner, until the breach in the last retrenchment is
crowned and the preparations for the final attack upon
the garrison are made, or the place surrenders. If the
garrison takes refuge in an interior keep and continues
the defence the keep must be reduced by similar
methods.</p>

<p id="I_art95"><b>95.</b> <b>Additional Operations in the Attack of an
Intrenched Camp.</b>&mdash;The operations above described
are those necessary to reduce a fortified place of the
older type, or a detached work of an intrenched camp.
The latter, though of less extent and with a smaller
garrison, offers as a rule greater resisting power, since
it is usually subject to front fire only, has more complete
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
bomb-proof cover, and is free from the presence
of non-combatants.</p>

<p>While a great advantage is gained by the capture of
two or more of the advanced forts, the resisting power
of the intrenched camp is by no means destroyed.
These forts are subject to the fire of the collateral
works, of which frequently two or more must be silenced
before a further advance can be made. The
beleaguered army may still be in condition to recapture
the forts by vigorous assaults; and in almost every
case, before the fall of the works of the outer line, a
line of provisional fortifications of high resisting power,
connected by trenches, will have been constructed by
the defence in rear of the captured works, with its
flanks secured by the collateral works of the outer
line. An assault against works of this class offers no
prospect of success. The besieger is therefore obliged,
as soon as he captures a detached fort, to put it in
condition to withstand the assaults of the besieged
army and to afford protection from the artillery fire of
the collateral works, and then to push forward his approaches
against the successive positions prepared by
the defence, which will as a rule present a front equal
to or greater than that which can be occupied by
the attack. The gorges of the captured works are repaired
and strengthened, covered communications are
made through the faces, either through the breaches
or in more convenient points, traverses are repaired or
built to protect against the fire of the collateral works,
and the captured works are connected by trenches
which afford emplacements for batteries and form a
new parallel from which the saps can be driven in attacking
the intermediate works. Simultaneously with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
this attack, it is usually advisable to advance from the
flanks of the first or second parallel upon the forts of
the outer line which form the flanks of the intermediate
line. The approaches can generally be driven with
comparative ease owing to these works having already
been partly disabled and now being subject to a flank
and reverse fire from the newly-established batteries.</p>

<p>The flanks of the intermediate line being turned by
the capture of these works, a portion or the whole of
it will of necessity be abandoned. The subsequent
operations up to the capture of the enceinte will be of
the same nature as those already described.</p>

<p id="I_art96"><b>96.</b> <b>Occupation of a Conquered Place.</b>&mdash;Immediately
upon the fall of the place it must be occupied
by a force (chosen when possible from the reserve
which has not participated in the final assault) sufficient
to control not only the inhabitants, but also the disorderly
soldiers of the attacking force. All pillaging,
wanton destruction, and abuse of the conquered must
be restrained with a strong hand, immediate and exemplary
punishment being inflicted upon offenders.
The orderly portion of the defenders must be protected,
and such steps taken for supplying their needs
as humanity requires; while the disorderly ones must
be repressed with such severity as may be necessary.
So soon as order is established a careful inventory of
captured property is made, and it is stored subject to
the orders of the government. When the possibility
exists of the place being attacked or besieged by the
enemy, all its resources which are available for defence
are collected, repaired, and stored for use.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span></p>

<h3 id="Vaubans_Maxims">VAUBAN’S MAXIMS.</h3>

<p id="I_art97"><b>97.</b> Marshal Vauban, the great French military
engineer (born 1633, died 1707), whose experience
and success in sieges made him the great authority
on the subject, formulated certain maxims for governing
the conduct of a siege, the observance of which
led to almost certain success, and the departure from
them almost invariably resulted disastrously. The
most of these are as applicable to sieges of to-day as
they were to those of his own time. The following<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a>
bear upon the second and third periods of the attack:</p>

<p>1st. To delay the opening of the trenches until the
besieging forces are all well posted and made secure
by fortifications from an attack either from the garrison
or from a succoring force; and until everything requisite
for carrying on the work vigorously has been
collected and is ready at hand when wanted.</p>

<p>2d. To make a single attack rather than a double
one, unless the two attacks can be well connected and
the besieging force exceeds considerably in strength
the garrison. This, as a matter of course, excludes
false attacks, and double separate attacks, unless the
superiority of the besieging force is very great. By a
single attack is understood one by which it is proposed
to gain possession of the main work by a single breach
at some point; by a double attack it is proposed to
effect two breaches of the main work. The advantage
of the latter lies in forcing the garrison to divide their
strength for the defence of the two breaches, whilst the
assailing forces, being under one leadership, can at any
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
moment concentrate if necessary upon the point most
favorable to their assault.</p>

<p>3d. To embrace within the parallels and approaches
all the defences which bear upon the site to be occupied
by the besieger’s works, in order to have secure positions
for establishing the batteries that may be required
to silence the fire of these defences.</p>

<p>4th. To multiply the approaches, with the view of
giving mutual support, less encumbered communications,
and dividing the fire of the defences, which, if
concentrated upon a single one, might soon destroy it.</p>

<p>5th. To throw up at least three main lines of parallels,
placing them in the best positions for mutual
support and for guarding the approaches and batteries
from sorties of the besieged.</p>

<p>6th. To avoid attacking a point upon which the
approaches can be run only on a narrow front, or one
which can only be approached over marshy ground, or
on causeways.</p>

<p>7th. To be careful not to push forward any portion
of the trenches until they are well flanked and protected
by trenches in their rear, which are completed
and occupied by troops.</p>

<p>8th. To avoid encumbering the approaches with trench
materials, tools, workmen, or troops; placing all of
these in the parallels, on the right and left of the approaches,
so as to be ready at hand when wanted, and
to be rapidly sent forward through the trenches of the
approaches, which should be kept free for this purpose.</p>

<p>9th. To place the ricochet (enfilading) batteries in
such positions that they can have an enfilading and
slant reverse fire upon the guns of the defences to be
attained by them.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span></p>

<p>10th. To refrain from opening fire from any series
of batteries until it can be done at the same moment
from all of them.</p>

<p>[In connection with this and other siege operations,
Vauban remarks that precipitation in sieges does not
hasten the close of them, but often prolongs them and
renders them more bloody.]</p>

<p>11th. To employ the fire of the batteries and trenches,
rather than open assaults, to drive the besieged from
their defences, before attempting to occupy them by
the besieging force.</p>

<p>12th. When it is decided to make an open assault,
to do so by day, if there is no portion of the fire of the
defences which bears upon the point to be carried that
is not completely kept under by the fire of the batteries
and trenches; but, in the contrary case, when the fire
of the defences is not completely kept under, to make
a night assault.</p>

<p>13th. Not to attempt an obstinate resistance to an
open assault of the besieged upon any unfinished portion
of the trenches; but rather to withdraw the workmen
and the few troops near them to some point behind
the parallel immediately in rear, and then to open
a vigorous fire from it upon the assailing force.</p>

<p>14th. To keep within the cover of the parallel when
the assailant is advancing to the assault, and leave him
to expose himself to its fire as long as he pleases, and
then, when he is well cut up, and has got thrown into
confusion, as he necessarily will at night, in the trenches
that he may have carried, to fall upon him with the
bayonet and drive him out.</p>

<p>15th. Not to push such charges too far from the
parallel, but to retire promptly, so soon as the assailant
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
has fairly taken to flight, within the cover of the
parallel, so as not to draw the fire of the besieged
works.</p>

<br />
<span class="large">THE DEFENCE.</span></h2>

<p id="I_art99"><b>99.</b> <b>Preliminary Considerations.</b>&mdash;The defence of
a fortified place is entrusted to a commanding officer,
who, when the siege is established, is generally known
as the “Governor of the Place.” His duties become
more exacting and his powers more absolute from the
beginning of hostilities until the place is invested and
cut off from communication with the exterior, when,
since the whole responsibility of the defence rests upon
him, his powers over both the garrison and the inhabitants
of the place, of necessity become autocratic in all
matters affecting the defence, directly or indirectly.
He, of course, avails himself of the counsel and advice
of his subordinate officers and may make up a “Council
of Defence” from his second in command and the
commander of the engineers and of the artillery; but
the ultimate decision of all questions must rest with
him alone.</p>

<p>During peace and after the beginning of hostilities
up to the near approach of the investing force, the
civil authorities retain their ordinary jurisdiction, unless
martial law is declared by proper authority; but after
the place is invested, martial law (or state of siege)
exists from necessity, and the police power, the control
of provisions and supplies of all kinds, public and
private, buildings, animals, vehicles, etc., and everything
necessary for the defence of the place fall into the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
hands of the governor, who also is empowered to
direct who shall be sent out and who shall be retained
within the place, and what necessary service or labor
shall be performed by the inhabitants. Having been
selected for these onerous and exacting duties, he,
under no circumstances, allows himself to be cut off
from his post, and is therefore debarred from leading
his troops in person in the active operations outside
the work or exposing himself unnecessarily or recklessly
during any period of the siege.</p>

<p id="I_art100"><b>100.</b> <b>The Garrison.</b>&mdash;The garrison should consist of
artillery and infantry, and, in an intrenched camp, of
enough mounted troops for escort, messenger, and a
limited vedette service.</p>

<p>The strength of the infantry is generally regulated so
as to give a suitable garrison to each detached work, and
about 1½ to 2 men for each yard of the front of attack.
The artillery is allowed about 12 men for each gun.
The number of engineers is determined for each place
by the probable amount of engineer work that will be
required. These troops make up about one-third of
the entire force.</p>

<p>A general reserve of all arms (principally, however,
foot troops) makes up the other two-thirds, and is
held as “a fighting force” for preventing the investment
of the place, or for breaking up the investing
lines when established. This reserve is called upon for
work on the front of attack or in the trenches only when
it cannot be avoided.</p>

<p>In smaller places the portion of the garrison called
upon for the outer line of defence may be increased
to one-half or two-thirds, and the general reserve be
reduced to one-half or one-third of the entire force.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
When the investment is strongly established the general
reserve will usually be combined with the other troops.</p>

<p>The troops engaged on the front of attack are
usually assigned to the different sectors of attack and
are divided into reliefs (ordinarily three), each relief
having as a rule a tour of one day in the front lines, one
in the immediate supports, and one in the reserve and
in interior fatigue duty. The Governor, however, so
regulates the details as to impose upon the troops the
least work consistent with an energetic defence.</p>

<p id="I_art101"><b>101.</b> <b>Armament.</b>&mdash;The guns for arming the place
should be placed in position or in store within the
works before the beginning of hostilities. There should
be mounted in commanding positions a sufficient number
of high-power guns to hold the enemy’s first works
at a distance and to fire upon his camps, etc., if placed
too near. In addition to these, a full supply of light
guns, including machine and rapid-fire guns, should be
at all times equipped and supplied for immediate use in
meeting an assault or surprise. Their emplacements,
platforms, etc., should be in readiness for use at any
moment.</p>

<p>In large places and for an active defence there will
be needed also enough field-guns to properly equip the
general reserve (about 4 guns per 1000 men). These
should be considered a part of the equipment of the
reserve.</p>

<p>It being, from economical considerations, impossible
to supply guns to fully arm all the fronts of a place,
enough only are usually provided to thoroughly equip
the sector of attack and to replace those disabled.
These are stored within the place where they are
secure against deterioration or injury, and are mounted
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
in the sector of attack when it is definitely determined.
The numbers of high-powered guns, howitzers, mortars,
and machine and rapid-fire guns needed must be determined
from the size of the place, its garrison, and the
character of attack which may be expected.</p>

<p id="I_art102"><b>102.</b> <b>Ammunition, Provisions and Supplies.</b>&mdash;A
plentiful supply of ammunition, especially of projectiles,
for all the guns should be kept constantly on
hand. The projectiles, which may be stored for an indefinite
term without deterioration, may be distributed
in magazines in proximity to their batteries; the powder
should be so stored as to preserve its properties,
and be distributed to the service magazines at such
times and in such quantities as may be necessary.
Other equipments will be stored and handled in accordance
with the same principles.</p>

<p>The utmost care will be taken in storing and issuing
the provisions and supplies belonging to the troops;
and in cases of necessity during the siege the sales of
provisions to the inhabitants by the dealers will be
regulated, both in prices and quantities, by the military
governor.</p>

<p id="I_art103"><b>103.</b> <b>Sanitation and Hygiene.</b>&mdash;The most rigid
sanitary measures and rules of hygiene should be
enforced from the beginning of the siege, under the
direction of the military governor, whose medical officers
should join with the health officers of the place (if
any exist) in guarding not only the troops but all
the inhabitants from all avoidable causes of epidemic
diseases. Extreme rigor in carrying out these regulations
in not only allowable, but is most urgently
required.</p>

<p id="I_art104"><b>104.</b> <b>Preparations for Defence.</b>&mdash;An active defence
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
being presupposed, all possible measures for its execution
should be taken before the near approach of the
enemy interferes with them. The principal ones are as
follows, viz.: Advanced posts are established as far
from the work as is prudent, say 3500 to 4000 yards,
placed at points which may be easily defended or
which would be advantageous positions for the enemy’s
batteries, etc. These, when possible, should be so
placed that the ground between them is swept by
their infantry fire and by the artillery of the place.
They should be provided with good cover for the
troops, and parapets for infantry and field-guns.
When not naturally strong, field-works should be built.
Quarries, ditches, sunken roads, villages, woods, etc.,
should be taken advantage of, either as points of defence,
passive obstacles, or covers for communications,
as may be best. Lines of retreat to the work as secure
as possible from hostile fire should be provided. All
supplies in the vicinity of the work which will be useful
during the siege should be collected and taken into
the place. Means of communicating with the exterior
by telegraph, telephone, signal flags, lanterns and
heliotropes, carrier-pigeons and balloons, should be
secured. Search-lights for illuminating the exterior
should be obtained, and as soon as practicable bomb-proofs
and shelters for the inhabitants should be prepared
in the body of the place; and in connection
with the civil authorities the fire department of the
place should be organized and taught how to extinguish
fires with dry earth and by pulling down buildings
when water is not available.</p>

<p>The service of security and information should be
extended to the furthest possible limit, not only by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
outposts, etc., but by telegraph operators and reliable
correspondents at long distances from the place; and
preparations should be made to retard the approach of
the enemy by the destruction of the roads, bridges, etc.</p>

<p id="I_art105"><b>105.</b> <b>Defence during the First Period of the
Siege.</b>&mdash;Upon the approach of the enemy each work
should receive its permanent garrison, and the fighting
reserve should go out to occupy the advanced posts
and to take full advantage of its interior lines to hold
him back and punish any careless or ill-advised advance,
being aided in this when possible by the fire of
the heavy guns of the place. Care must be taken to
avoid too great dispersion of the troops, and exposing
advanced parties to being cut off and captured by pushing
them too far to the front or holding their positions
too long; but no opportunity should be missed of attacking
and destroying or beating back hostile detachments
when tactical conditions warrant it.</p>

<p>The defence during the first part of this period differs
but little from the ordinary defence of an intrenched
battle-field. The principal differences arise
from the fact that the flanks of the advanced lines and
the lines of retreat to the work are so well covered that
with ordinary precautions they may be considered
secure, and all energies may be directed to meeting the
front attack and executing offensive returns. So soon
as the point of attack selected by the enemy becomes
known the advanced positions may be more fully
manned and equipped; trenches with inconspicuous
parapets, or preferably without any, may be made to
cover the infantry, field-guns, and sometimes siege-guns
on travelling carriages. These positions may be,
as previously stated, 2500 to 3000 yards from the permanent
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
works, and the intervals between them may be
swept by the heavy guns of the latter.</p>

<p>If these positions can be so strongly held as to compel
the besieger to attack them with his heavy guns, he will
be compelled to establish his first artillery position at a
very great distance&mdash;possibly 5000 to 6000 yards from
the work. [At Belfort, 1870, positions of this kind
were taken only after seventy-seven days of siege.]</p>

<p>As the advanced positions may be subject to the fire
of the heaviest class of siege-guns, if any parapet is
made it should be of the nature of a glacis of gentle
slope and little command. Infantry trenches should
be made narrow and deep as a protection against shells
and shrapnel (<a href="#pl_09">Pl. IX</a>, Fig. 84), and gun-emplacements
should be as small as practicable and almost entirely in
excavation, for the same reason. Positions so prepared
suffer very little from gun-fire, and will frequently
require attack by systematic approaches.</p>

<p>An efficient outpost service must be maintained in
front of these positions to prevent their being taken
by surprise.</p>

<p>When but a limited number of troops are available
for defence it is of course impossible to push out the
advanced posts so far to the front. In all cases, however,
they should be placed at the greatest practicable
distance.</p>

<p id="I_art106"><b>106.</b> <b>Opening of Artillery-fire by the Defence.</b>&mdash;The
artillery-fire of the defence should be opened
upon the besieger’s batteries, etc., before they are
ready for action, so that the ranges may be obtained
and the tables of fire corrected without interference by
the hostile fire. If this can be accomplished, the increased
effect due to the accurate fire of the defence
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
may more than counterbalance the numerical superiority
of the attack, and result in preventing the completion
of some of his batteries and in silencing others.</p>

<p>If, on the other hand, the attack anticipates the defence
in obtaining the range, his superiority in numbers
and accuracy will frequently necessitate abandoning
some emplacements and mounting the guns in
others, where they may be used in the later stages of
the siege.</p>

<p id="I_art107"><b>107.</b> <b>Defence during the Bombardment and Assault.</b>&mdash;The
amount of ammunition which can be profitably
expended by the defence during the bombardment
must be determined by the quantity on hand and
the advisability of exposing by their fire the positions
of the guns.</p>

<p>The infantry troops and the light guns are held
under cover, ready to be moved forward to meet the
assault if made. Special care will be taken to avoid
being deceived by false attacks; and the assault, if
made, will be met as previously described (par. 6).</p>

<p>If the attack is repulsed, an offensive return may be
made by the general reserve, assisted, when necessary,
by the local reserves of the front of attack; but the
garrisons of the permanent works should not be withdrawn
from them for this purpose, as it is always possible
that they may be needed to protect the works
and cover a retreat. If the assault succeeds, the
defenders will retire to their positions in rear, from
which the strongest possible fire will be directed upon
the pursuing troops and upon the captured position to
render its possession difficult or impossible. If the
assailants are driven off, the position is immediately
reoccupied by the defence.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span></p>

<p id="I_art108"><b>108.</b> <b>Defence during the Second Period of the
Siege.</b>&mdash;The point of attack having been definitely
determined by the preliminary steps of the attack in
opening the parallels and establishing the batteries, the
besieged will at once proceed to mount extra guns and
reinforce the troops upon the threatened fronts. He
will keep his outposts or sentinels during this and the
subsequent periods as far to the front as possible, to
prevent surprises and to keep out reconnoitring parties
spies, etc., etc.</p>

<p>From observations previously established, he will
locate at the earliest possible moment the batteries,
etc., of the attack, and will prevent their completion
and arming by the use of shells and case-shot charged
with high explosives, fired from howitzers and mortars.
He will use his long guns for counter-battering those
of the besieger, and generally for direct fire upon exposed
targets.</p>

<p>By taking the initiative he may frequently obtain
the upper hand in the artillery duel, and possibly be
able to prepare the way for strong sorties, and the
destruction of the besieger’s works. In any case he
must at this stage develop the full fire of his guns and
work them to their maximum value.</p>

<p>If, however, the superiority of the artillery of the
attack is pronounced, and it becomes impracticable to
serve any battery advantageously, it will be better to
dismount its guns and remount them in other positions,
as indicated in the preceding paragraph (par. 106).</p>

<p>All efforts will be made to prevent the construction
of the parallels and approaches, their positions being
discovered by the use of the search and other lights,
and the work upon them retarded by direct and curved
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
fire. For the latter light rifled mortars promise to be
very effective.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a></p>

<p>The trenches connecting the detached and intermediate
works will be strengthened, and counter-approaches
will when practicable be driven out to afford
positions for enfilading the approaches. The field and
machine guns will be held in constant readiness for use,
and will be brought into action at every favorable opportunity;
but will be withdrawn and placed under
cover previously prepared so soon as the fire upon
them becomes too severe to be endured.</p>

<p>Meanwhile a new position in rear, with its flanks supported
upon the adjacent detached works, will be selected
and made ready for defence in case the front
line is taken.</p>

<p>The general reserve will be used for offensive movements,
which are made whenever favorable opportunities
arise, particularly in making counter-attacks after
unsuccessful assaults.</p>

<p id="I_art109"><b>109.</b> <b>Defence during the Third Period.</b>&mdash;The defence
of the detached works of an intrenched camp
during the Third Period will be conducted, so far as
the general reserve is concerned, in very much the
same manner as during the Second Period; but in the
immediate defence of the detached work itself, owing
to the close approach of the besieger, its character will
change. The artillery except the field and machine
guns will be silenced, and the latter will usually be only
available for defending the ditches and for repelling
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
assaults. Light guns will, however, be held in readiness
for temporary use when practicable.</p>

<p>The outposts will of necessity be drawn in and replaced
by a chain of sentinels along the parapets of
the covered way or the main parapet, who will pick off
the besiegers at every possible chance, and will be reinforced
by the rest of the garrison when an assault is
imminent. All flanking defences will be kept in as
good condition as possible, and in readiness to prevent
the crossing of the ditch, or to repulse an assault.
Grenades and shells will be kept in readiness to roll
into the ditch, the breaches will be obstructed and
mined if practicable, counter-mines will be brought into
play, and all other possible measures taken to retard
the approach of the besieger to the breach and to repel
his assaults. When, however, the work is reduced
to such a state as to make its defence hopeless, it
should not be held at the expense of great losses to
the defence, unless the besieger’s works can be considerably
delayed by doing so. When the position consists
of an enceinte with ordinary outworks, the investment
during the Third Period of the siege will be
closer, the opportunities for using the general reserve
will usually disappear, and its troops will be merged
with those of the general defence.</p>

<p>When, in this case, the place is to be defended to the
last, all measures will be taken for the defence of the
breach; and after this is carried, for the final defence
of the inner retrenchments or keeps.</p>

<p>The tactical handling of the garrison for this purpose
is in accordance with the principles already laid
down (par. 6, and Art of War, pars. 282-84.)</p>

<p>The sorties recommended during a siege are, when
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
made by the general reserve and in large bodies, usually
carried out by moving the troops from the collateral
works upon the flanks of the besieger’s works. In
the close attack, however, they may be made by small
parties moving to the front from the nearest outpost
or salient. The object in all cases is the same&mdash;to destroy
the enemy’s works, delay his advance, and inflict
upon him all possible loss.</p>

<h3 id="The_Capitulation">THE CAPITULATION.</h3>

<p id="I_art110"><b>110.</b> Should the defensive policy of the state not require
a place to be held to extremity, the governor
must be fully informed of the fact, and the extent of
the defence and the conditions of capitulation must
be fully understood by him before the investment. As
a rule, however, no excuse will be received for the surrender
of a place until every means of defence is exhausted,
and further resistance is not only hopeless,
but impossible, the only rule which can guide the governor
being that “one additional day of defence may
be of incalculable benefit to his country.” The old
rule, copied from the French, but no longer observed
by them, requires the defence to sustain at least one assault
on a practicable breach in the body of the place.</p>

<p>Within recent years, in civilized warfare, no cases
have occurred in which such assaults have been made,
the places having been reduced by the more distant
attack; but assuming such an assault to be repulsed, it
will not justify the surrender of the place so long as a
possibility of repulsing similar assaults exists. The
garrison must withstand all attacks of whatever nature
to the last extremity, and continue the defence up to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
the full requirements of duty and honor&mdash;surrendering
only when nothing else is possible.</p>

<h3 id="Journal_of_the_Defence">JOURNAL OF THE DEFENCE.</h3>

<p id="I_art111"><b>111.</b> <b>A Journal of the Defence</b>, entirely similar to
that of the attack, will be kept by the besieged for use
by the War Department in case of a successful defence.
Nothing should be entered in the journal which might
be of special value to the besieger in case the place is
taken, but a separate journal of such matter should be
kept in cipher, or should be destroyed before the surrender
of the place.

<h3 id="Parks_and_Depots">PARKS AND DEPOTS.</h3>

<p id="I_art112"><b>112.</b> <b>The Engineer and Artillery Parks and
Depots</b> are located and arranged for security against
the artillery-fire and the attack, by surprise or otherwise,
of the defence, and also for facility in receiving,
storing, and distributing materials and supplies.</p>

<p>The first condition is fulfilled by placing them at a
safe distance, concealing them from the view of the
defence if possible, and guarding them against attack,
and the access of incendiaries, etc., by strict application
of ordinary defensive tactics, and a most thorough
system of interior guards. Powder depots, trains, etc.,
especially are guarded against the access of all unauthorized
persons.</p>

<p>The second condition, when railroad communication
is used, is satisfied by making the park conform to the
best-planned railroad terminals and freight-yards. A
type arrangement is given in Plate IX, Fig. 85, in
which switches from the main line give access to as
many side-tracks, <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>, etc., and spurs, 1, 2, 3, etc.,
as may be needed. When practicable, these sidings
should connect at each end with the main line in order
to afford free ingress and egress from both directions.
They should be placed at such distances apart as to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
allow loading-platforms and the desired room for sheds,
piles of materials, etc., between them; large areas being
left for light, and small for heavy, materials. The
spurs, 1, 2, 3, etc., should preferably be short; but if
long, should be connected by switches. A <span style="font-size: 120%; font-family: sans-serif">Y</span>, as indicated,
is frequently convenient for reversing complete
trains without uncoupling the cars, and is indispensable
when a turn-table is not available.</p>

<p>When the powder-depot is separated from the main
park it is better to reach it by a special track branching
from the main line at some distance from the park,
so that the ammunition-trains will not pass through or
near the latter. The sketch given is proposed as a
type only, since the park may occupy one or both
sides of the main line, be long and narrow, short and
broad, regular or irregular in outline, as may best conform
to the ground available.</p>

<p>Standard-gauge roads will, when practicable, be laid
between the main park and the smaller depots. When
this is not feasible, narrow-gauge tram-roads will be
used instead, and will also connect the smaller depots
with the trenches and batteries. The portable tramways
used by contractors are well fitted for use in the
trenches.</p>

<p>When the park is located upon navigable water a
number of piers and wharves are occupied. They
should be provided with derricks or cranes, and tracks
and cars upon which materials may be loaded directly
from the ships. The park may then be arranged on
the general plan above indicated. The switches are
so arranged as to allow empty cars to return to the
wharves on a track different from that used by the
loaded ones.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span></p>

<p>In storing materials and supplies in the park care
must be taken to place each class by itself, and to so
pile them that they can be readily inventoried and
inspected, and be removed or replaced without disturbing
other piles. This requires the piles to be arranged
in regular order, with unobstructed passages between
them, and prohibits piling articles of different kinds or
sizes on top of each other.</p>

<h3 id="Shelters_and_Huts">SHELTERS AND HUTS.</h3>

<p id="I_art113"><b>113.</b> In a regular siege, the besieging army will, as a
regular rule, eventually be provided with tents or portable
huts for shelter; but before this is accomplished
much suffering and consequent disease may result
from exposure, which could be avoided by the construction
of temporary shelters, huts, and screens from
materials available for this purpose.</p>

<p>In severe winter weather tents and thin wooden huts
do not afford sufficient protection, and it may be necessary
to substitute for them others with walls of logs,
sods, sand-bags, adobe, or other materials, or even
huts partly or entirely sunk into the earth. The
greatest care must be exercised in enforcing proper
ventilation and cleanliness in huts of this class. If
this is not done serious fevers and other camp diseases
are almost sure to occur. (Art of War, Art. 352-3.)
The figures given (Plate IX, Figs. 86-94) have been
selected from a great many examples to serve as suggestions.
They may be modified or combined, as circumstances
require. Their construction is evident
from the figures, and requires no description. Ditches
surrounding the huts are made to carry off rain-water.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
Heavy roofs are supported by poles set up inside the
hut as needed. Fireplaces are dug in the sides of the
excavation, or are built up of sods, clay, etc. It is
better to make two, as shown, to obtain a good draught
in any wind. Chimneys are made of sods or of sticks
plastered with clay, unless drain-tiles, tin cans, or other
suitable materials can be found. Great care must be
taken to prevent their setting the roof on fire.</p>

<p>In many cases water-proof roofing felts and papers
may be obtained and used for roofs, etc., in huts and
shelters. The lumber from packing-boxes, tin from
canned vegetables, and wire from baled forage may
frequently be utilized for doors, chimneys, ties, etc.
Straw mats for mattresses, etc., are economical in the
use of straw and conduce to cleanliness, as they can be
easily taken up and replaced. The method of making
them is shown in <a href="#pl_09">Pl. IX</a>, Fig. 95. When twine is not at
hand, they may be woven of straw rope. They, as well
as all other bedding, should be taken out and sunned
every dry day. Ordinary hurdles laid upon the ground
or raised a few inches above it protect the blankets, etc.,
from the moisture of the earth.</p>

<p>It cannot be too strongly impressed upon officers,
that all devices of the kind above indicated, which add
to the comfort of the men, add also to their health,
morale, and efficiency.</p>

<h3 id="Kitchens_and_Ovens">KITCHENS AND OVENS.</h3>

<p id="I_art114"><b>114.</b> In our service a company will usually have a
camp-cooking outfit sufficient for its needs, and generally
of good pattern; but these are not always on hand
when needed, and small detachments are frequently
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
deprived of them for days or weeks. In ordinary soil,
kitchens, and in a clay soil ovens, can be constructed,
which, with a few kettles and cans, will enable the men
to prepare for themselves fairly good meals without
unnecessary waste of fuel. A few of these are figured
in Pls. IX, X, Figs. 96-103. The banks of the trench
shown in Fig. 96 afford support for cross-bars, and protect
the fire from the wind. The type shown in Figs.
97, 102, 103 take the place of a stove, require but little
fuel, and secure a steady heat. To obtain a good
draught they should be so built that the wind blows
toward the chimney. For this purpose they may radiate
from a central chimney. (The flues of those not
in use may be temporarily stopped up with sods.) The
arch of the oven shown in <a href="#pl_10">Pl. X</a>, Fgs. 98-101, may be
built over a piece of sheet iron if it can be obtained; if
not, over a hurdle well smeared with clay. A slow fire
will, under favorable conditions, dry and bake the clay
arch so that it will stand after the brushwood of the
hurdle is burned out. They may then be heated and
used for baking.</p>

<h3 id="Latrines_Sinks_etc">LATRINES, SINKS, ETC.</h3>

<p id="I_art115"><b>115.</b> Latrines and sinks for the reception of garbage,
etc., are objects of the greatest importance in all camps,
temporary or permanent; and, unless properly made and
cared for, they speedily make their presence known, and
become a most prolific source of discomfort and disease.</p>

<p>For permanent camps liable to be occupied for a
long time special arrangements for the disinfection, removal,
and destruction of garbage and excreta must be
made. For temporary camps it will suffice to provide
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
pits with suitable conveniences and screens; covering
with a thin layer of the excavated earth all deposited
garbage and excreta before they become offensive.
When, as is sometimes the case, these pits cannot be
kept free from water, it may be necessary to use in addition
lime, copperas, carbolic acid, or other chemical
disinfectants and deodorizers.</p>

<p>The ordinary constructions used in temporary camps
are shown in <a href="#pl_10">Pl. X</a>, Figs. 104-107. Separate latrines for
officers are constructed and screened. The seat shown
in Fig. 107, when one can be obtained, adds much to
their comfort.</p>

<p>In more permanent camps the latrines may be roofed
and screened with canvas or boards, and board seats
be provided for the men. Uninclosed sinks and latrines
should have earthen banks all around them, to
indicate their position and to prevent men walking into
them at night. Upon abandoning a camp all sinks and
latrines are to be disinfected and filled up.</p>

<h3 id="Water-supply">WATER-SUPPLY.</h3>

<p id="I_art116"><b>116.</b> The problem of obtaining a sufficient and wholesome
water-supply for a besieging army is usually one
difficult of solution. The precautions which are necessary
in ordinary camps (Art. of War, 352 and 358) become
of still greater importance in this case, owing to
the choice of the source of supply being limited to
those which are not controlled by the besieged, and to
the constantly increasing danger of pollution of all
ground waters by the bodies of the dead men and animals
and the refuse and filth of the camps. The evils
arising from these sources may be largely or entirely
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
removed by boiling the drinking-water, and the disagreeable
tastes and smells may be removed by filtering
through good filters. It is very difficult, however,
to compel the men to boil the water, or to drink it
after it is boiled, unless it is properly aerated and filtered.
All available measures should, therefore, be
adopted to supply them with wholesome water.</p>

<p>The results of the most recent researches show that
properly conducted <i>intermittent filtration</i> with sand-filters
will render a polluted water almost if not entirely
safe. (See reports of Massachusetts State Board
of Health on Purification of Sewage and Water, 1890.)
And the analysis of water sterilized by a steam-jet at
the Columbian Exposition in Chicago, 1893, gives reason
to believe that this process may be very effective
in removing disease germs. (See report of Allen
Hazen, Chemist, Department of Water-supply, published
in <i>Engineering News</i>, March 29, 1894.) In
camps of some permanence one or both of these processes
may be well worth applying.</p>

<p>Small filters for limited amounts of water may be
bought in the market, or may be improvised and set up
for officers or company messes. Figs. 108-110, <a href="#pl_10">Pl. X</a>,
are given as suggestions; they serve as strainers in any
case. If used intermittently they <i>may</i> have a high sanitary
value, and if made up partly of either animal or
wood charcoal they remove more or less completely
any offensive taste or odor which water may have.
Security, however, requires doubtful water to be
boiled.</p>

<p>In all cases arrangements should be made to protect
the water from surface pollution, for convenient access
for the men, and for watering horses.

<p id="II_art1"><b>1.</b> <b>Military Mining</b> includes all the operations necessary
for placing charges of explosive underground and
exploding them at the time desired, for the purpose of
destroying the men, materials, or works in their vicinity,
or for breaking up the surface of the ground either to
advance or retard the operations of a siege.</p>

<p>The excavation for receiving the <i>charge</i> is called the
<i>chamber</i>. The approaches leading to the chamber
when horizontal or somewhat inclined are called <i>galleries</i>,
and when vertical are known as <i>shafts</i>. When
very steep they are sometimes called <i>slopes</i>. The
charge, chamber, and approaches taken together constitute
a <i>mine</i>.</p>

<p>The pit formed by the explosion is called the <i>crater</i>.</p>

<p>When the ground is homogeneous and its surface
horizontal, the intersection of its surface by the crater
is approximately a circle, the radius of which is called
the <i>crater radius</i>, <i>AB</i>, <a href="#pl_11">Pl. XI</a>, Fig. 1.</p>

<p>The right line joining the centre of the charge with
the nearest point of the surface toward which the
explosion will take place, generally the surface of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
ground, is called the <i>line of least resistance</i> (written
generally L. L. R.), <i>C B</i>, <a href="#pl_11">Pl. XI</a>, Fig. 1.</p>

<p>A right line from the centre of the charge to the
edge of the crater is called the <i>radius of explosion</i>,
<i>C D</i>, <a href="#pl_11">Pl. XI</a>, Fig. 1.</p>

<p>The distance from the centre of the charge at which
an ordinary mining gallery will be broken in by the
explosion is called the <i>radius of rupture</i>, <i>C L</i>, <a href="#pl_11">Pl. XI</a>,
Fig. 3. The radius of rupture varies in length with its
inclination to the horizontal.</p>

<p>Craters whose <i>diameters</i> are once, twice, etc., their
lines of least resistance are called <i>one-lined</i>, <i>two-lined</i>,
etc., craters.</p>

<p>Mines in which the L. L. R. is equal to the <i>crater
radius</i> are called <i>common mines</i>. (Their craters are <i>two-lined</i>.)
Those in which the crater radius exceeds the
L. L. R. are called <i>overcharged mines</i> or <i>globes of compression</i>;
when it is less, they are <i>undercharged mines</i>;
and when the charge is so small that no exterior crater
is formed, they are known as <i>camouflets</i>.</p>

<p id="II_art2"><b>2.</b> In the explosion of military mines on land it may
safely be assumed that the circumstances of combustion
of the charge when fired are such that the energy
developed is directly proportional to the charge. A
portion of this energy is generally lost by the escape of
the compressed gases into the air, by the heat given up
to the surrounding media, and by the transmission of
earth-waves or shock; the remainder and greater part,
however, is expended in rupturing the case containing
the charge, compressing the soil in its immediate vicinity,
separating that lifted up from that forming the sides
of the crater, breaking up the portion thrown out into
large or small fragments, projecting them to a greater
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
or less distance, and disintegrating the soil around the
crater to a distance which varies with the soil and with
the quantity and character of the explosive used.</p>

<p>As the proportional part of the energy expended in
each of the effects above named cannot be determined
in any particular case, and as each case differs in some
respect from every other, it is manifestly impossible to
express in any mathematical formula a rule for determining
the exact amount of explosive required for any
particular mine.</p>

<p>From the results of long experience, however, engineers
have concluded that computations sufficiently
exact for practical purposes can be made upon the
hypothesis that <i>for common mines and those approximating
closely to them in form</i>, the volumes of the craters
are directly proportional to the charges used.</p>

<p id="II_art3"><b>3.</b> In order to apply this rule in practice the volumes
of craters formed by known charges must be
measured; but since the soil in the immediate vicinity
of the crater is more or less disintegrated, and the
crater itself is partly filled up by the material which falls
back into it, the outlines of the original crater cannot
usually be recognized or its exact geometrical figure be
determined. Besides, the craters formed under circumstances
seemingly identical differ more or less among
themselves.</p>

<p>For convenience in computation, however, several
simple geometrical figures have been assumed as giving
with sufficient accuracy the form of the crater of a common
mine. See <a href="#pl_11">Pl. XI</a>, Fig. 1. Among these Vauban
assumed a cone, <i>ACD</i>, with its vertex at the centre of
the charge; Valière a paraboloid of revolution, <i>AHD</i>,
with its focus at the centre of the charge; Müller truncated
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
this paraboloid by a horizontal plane through its
focus; while Gumpertz and Lebrun adopted the form
in common use at their time, and which has been generally
accepted since, viz., a frustum of a cone, <i>AEFD</i>,
the smaller base of which passes through the centre of
the charge and has a radius, <i>EC</i>, equal to one-half the
crater radius, <i>AB</i> (or one-half L. L. R., <i>CB</i>).</p>

<p>The volumes of these figures are as follows:</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Vauban’s cone</td>
    <td>1.05 (L. L. R.)<sup>3</sup>,</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Valière’s paraboloid</td>
    <td>1.90 (L. L. R.)<sup>3</sup>,</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Müller’s truncated paraboloid</td>
    <td>1.84 (L. L. R.)<sup>3</sup>,</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The frustum of a cone</td>
    <td>1.83 (L. L. R.)<sup>3</sup> = nearly (<sup>11</sup>/<sub>6</sub>)(L. L R.)<sup>3</sup>.</td>
  </tr></table>

<p>The cone of Vauban (lately assumed also by Höfer)
was abandoned as unsatisfactory, because it did not conform
to the craters produced, and, as treated by Höfer,
because the charges computed by its use were found
to be too small (an error in the wrong direction). The
paraboloid of Valière or Müller would seem to conform
more nearly to the actual shape assumed by the crater;
but it will be observed that the volume of the latter is
sensibly the same as that of the truncated cone, and as
the volume of earth thrown out is the quantity to be
considered, the truncated cone will be assumed as the
measure for it.</p>

<p>To find from these data the relations between charges
for overcharged mines, construct Figs. 2 and 2<i>a</i>, (<a href="#pl_11">Pl.

<p>Fig. (2) gives mines with crater radii of 4<sup><i>y</i></sup> and 12<sup><i>y</i></sup>
and a common L. L. R. of 4<sup><i>y</i></sup>.</p>

<p>Divide the distance between <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> into four equal
parts, and assume the points of division as the extremities
of the crater radii of overcharged mines, each of which
exceeds the one next smaller by (¼)<i>AB</i>, and all corresponding
to a L. L. R. of 4<sup><i>y</i></sup>.</p>

<p>Fig. (2<i>a</i>) gives common mines with lines of least resistance
of 4<sup><i>y</i></sup> and 11<sup><i>y</i></sup>. Divide the distance <i>A´B´</i> also
into four equal parts, and assume the points of division
as the extremities of the crater radii of common mines
each of which exceeds the one next smaller by (¼)<i>A´B´</i>.</p>

<p>Since the charges for the common mines whose lines
of least resistance are respectively 4<sup><i>y</i></sup> and 11<sup><i>y</i></sup> are identical
with those of the overcharged mines whose crater
radii are 4<sup><i>y</i></sup> and 12<sup><i>y</i></sup> respectively, it is assumed that the
charges for the intermediate common mines are the
same as would be required to produce the corresponding
intermediate overcharged mines.</p>

resistance of any one of these common mines is equal
to <sup>7</sup>/<sub>8</sub> the increment of the crater radius of the corresponding

<p id="II_art9"><b>9. Radius of Rupture.</b>&mdash;The determination of the
<i>radius of rupture</i> is an important consideration in
underground warfare, since, when it is known, miners
may so place their chambers as to break in the galleries
of the enemy without injuring their own.</p>

<p>As different mining galleries, however, differ from
each other so much in strength to resist crushing, and
as the cost of an exhaustive series of experiments to
determine their relative strength would be so great
both in time and money, but little well-established data
exist upon which to found a rule for determining the
radius of rupture.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span></p>

<p id="II_art10"><b>10.</b> The rule deduced by Gumpertz and Lebrun,
however, from the material available at their time corresponds
very nearly with the results of later experiments
and observations, and is generally admitted as
sufficiently near correct for practical use.</p>

<p>This rule is based upon the theory that the surface
of rupture is an oblate spheroid, (<a href="#pl_11">Pl. XI</a>, Fig. 3), with
its axis of revolution vertical and its centre at the centre
of the charge; the intersection with the surface of the
ground <i>AD</i> coinciding with the edge of the crater. The
ratio between the semi-transverse axis <i>CF</i> and the semi-conjugate
axis <i>CH</i> of the generating ellipse of this assumed
spheroid is the same as that between the radius
of explosion <i>CD</i> and L. L. R., <i>CK</i>. The rule is, that
<i>the radius of rupture in any direction is equal the corresponding
radius of this spheroid</i>.</p>

<p>From the conditions assumed the following values of
the semi-transverse and semi-conjugate axes <i>h</i> and <i>v</i>

<p id="II_art12"><b>12.</b> There are other good reasons for believing that
Lebrun’s value for the vertical radius is too small; but

until more exact data are available.</p>

<h3 id="EXPLOSIVES">EXPLOSIVES.</h3>

<p id="II_art13"><b>13.</b> No military mining operations of note have been
carried on since the introduction of dynamite and
other high explosives; consequently our knowledge of
their value for work of this kind rests entirely upon the
results obtained from experimental mines. Unfortunately
but few experiments seem to have been made,
and the published results of these are very meagre.</p>

<p id="II_art14"><b>14.</b> Two mines fired at Krems in 1873 with L. L. R.
of 12 ft. in earth weighing 100 lbs. per cubic foot and
charged, one with 173 lbs. gunpowder, the other with
58 lbs. dynamite (kind not stated), gave crater radii,
respectively, of 12.75 and 10.25 feet. Lebrun’s formulas
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
applied to these give to gunpowder and dynamite
the ratio 1 : 1.688.</p>

<p>Two powder-mines and one dynamite-mine, each of
12 ft. L. L. R., were fired at Willet’s Point in 1878. The
powder-mines were each charged with 200 lbs. cannon-powder
and the dynamite mine with 82 lbs. dynamite
No. 1.</p>

<p>No. 1 powder-mine gave a crater radius of 15½ ft.</p>

<p>No. 2 powder-mine gave a crater radius of 15¼ ft., or
a mean of 15⅜ ft.</p>

<p>The dynamite-mine gave a crater radius of 14½ ft.</p>

<p>The relative values of cannon powder and dynamite
resulting from the application of the same formulas to
these mines is 1 : 1.997.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a></p>

<p id="II_art15"><b>15. Choice of Explosive.</b>&mdash;From these experimental
mines it may be concluded that for forming
craters in ordinary earth dynamite is not quite so efficient
as double its weight of good gunpowder. For
breaking up hard rock, blowing up strong masonry,
and especially in demolitions where tamping is usually
defective, this ratio does not hold; but the relative
effect of the high explosive increases continually with
the lack of tamping and the intensity of the local blow
desired, until a point is reached at which the effect of
gunpowder is almost imperceptible, while the high
explosive does efficient work. This property of the
high explosives renders them extremely valuable for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
use in hasty demolitions, such as blowing up palisades
or barriers, destroying guns, etc., etc.</p>

<p>Owing to their varying values in different conditions
the choice of explosive to be used in any particular
case must evidently depend upon the circumstances
attending it.</p>

<p>In underground explosions both gunpowder and
high explosives give out noxious gases which penetrate
the soil, and which entering a gallery in sufficient
quantity would suffocate the miners. Of these gases
the carbonic oxide given off by some of the high
explosives is probably the most dangerous to human
life, and if mixed with the proper proportion of air
forms an explosive mixture, resembling in this respect
the fire-damp of the coal-mines. Whether in practical
mining operations it would ever be retained in the soil
in such quantities as to produce this effect remains to
be seen.</p>

<p>Some of the high explosives, on the other hand,
seem to produce relatively small quantities of noxious
gases. The gases produced by gunpowder, while suffocating
in their nature, have the advantage of always
making their presence known by their odor.</p>

<p id="II_art16"><b>16.</b> For use in overcharged mines designed to break
in the enemy’s galleries, the high explosives, from the
violent character of their explosion and from the phenomena
exhibited in submarine mining, promise to
give relatively greater radii of rupture than gunpowder;
but sufficient data are not available to state
this positively.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span></p>

<p id="II_art17"><b>17.</b> Beside the considerations above stated, which
refer to the effects produced by the explosive when
fired, there are others equally important relating to the
safety and facility with which the explosive may be
transported, handled, and placed in the mines. The
latter will frequently have greater weight than the
former in determining the explosive to be used in any
particular case which may arise in the practical operations
of mining. Of the latter considerations some of
the most important in deciding whether to use gunpowder
or high explosives are the following, viz.:</p>

<p>Gunpowder is easily obtained, and most enlisted men
are more or less familiar with its properties.</p>

<p>It explodes when ignited by fire.</p>

<p>It does not ordinarily explode when struck by a
bullet.</p>

<p>It is injured by moisture and destroyed by thorough
wetting.</p>

<p>It is not affected by ordinary changes of temperature.</p>

<p>It requires thorough tamping to produce good
effects.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span></p>

<p>Many high explosives are not injured by moisture,
and some are unaffected by total immersion in water.</p>

<p>They generally burn without detonation if ignited by
flame.</p>

<p>Some of them do not explode when struck by a bullet.
The more sensitive ones do.</p>

<p>The properties of some of them are materially
changed by freezing.</p>

<p>On account of their greater strength, the same effects
may be produced by smaller charges, requiring smaller
chambers and cases.</p>

<p>By reason of the violence of their action they produce
good results even if imperfectly tamped.</p>

<p>The last two considerations, together with the possibility
of using them in wet places without protection
against moisture, lessen greatly the time required to
excavate, charge, and tamp a mine, and may frequently
enable the one using them to anticipate an enemy using
gunpowder and thus secure success, when the use of
gunpowder would reverse the situation. In mining
operations and in expert hands the high explosives,
upon the whole, seem to cause fewer accidents than
gunpowder.

<p id="II_art18"><b>18. Tools and Appliances.</b>&mdash;The different operations
of mining are carried on by the use of picks,
shovels, bars, saws, axes, hammers (large and small),
chisels, wheel and hand barrows, windlasses, ropes,
wooden or leather buckets, gauge-sticks, mason’s levels
(<a href="#pl_11">Pl. XI</a>, Fig. 4), plumb-lines, candles, closed lanterns,
tin pipes, rubber and canvas hose, canvas, nails, etc., etc.,
of the kinds in common use; and the following special
tools and appliances, viz.:</p>

<p>The <i>Miner’s Pick</i>. Smaller and lighter than the common
pick. Neither its head nor its handle exceeds 2
feet in length.</p>

<p>The <i>Miner’s Shovel</i>. Similar in shape to a common
shovel, but not exceeding 2 feet in length.</p>

<p>The <i>Push Pick</i> (<a href="#pl_11">Pl. XI</a>, Fig 5), which has a lance-shaped
blade about 3½ in. wide and 6 in. long attached
to a handle about 2 feet long.</p>

<p>The <i>Field Level</i> (<a href="#pl_11">Pl. XI</a>, Fig 6), which consists of
three strips of wood about 2" × ½", arranged as shown.
The strip <i>A</i> is 4' between centres of pins; <i>B</i> and <i>C</i> are
2', 9<sup>15</sup>/<sub>16</sub>"; the angle at a = 90°. A spirit-level is inserted
in piece <i>C</i>, and a plumb-line attached as shown. The
markings on <i>A</i> are used for gentle slopes, those on <i>B</i>
for steep ones.</p>

<p>The other sides of <i>B</i> and <i>C</i> are divided into degrees
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
of arc, the centre being at the middle point of the outside
edge of <i>A</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Slope Block</i>, which is a wooden cube used in connection
with a mason’s level for fixing slopes.</p>

<p><i>Angle Templets</i> (<a href="#pl_11">Pl. XI</a>, Fig. 7), making a definite
angle, used in laying out galleries.</p>

<p>The <i>Miner’s Truck or Car</i>. A small, four-wheeled
wagon with fixed axles and very short wheel-base; exterior
dimensions about 20" wide, 18" to 20" high, and
30" long. Used for carrying earth through galleries,
and usually hoisted up the shaft and dumped outside,
replacing the buckets used in sinking the shaft.</p>

<p>The <i>Miner’s Bellows</i> (<a href="#pl_11">Pl. XI</a>, Fig. 8). A leather bag
with wooden top and bottom, provided with inlet and
outlet valves, from the latter of which the air is led off
in pipes or hose. In using the bellows the miner stands
upon the lower handles and works the bellows with his
hands by the upper ones.</p>

<p>This is frequently replaced by a common blacksmith’s
bellows or the rotary blower from a portable forge; and
sometimes by an improvised air-pump, consisting of a
large open cask filled with water and another smaller one,
with one head removed and the other provided with
outlet and inlet valves and an air-tube, inverted over
the large cask, supported by a spring-pole and worked
up and down by hand in the water of the lower cask.</p>

<p>The <i>Miner’s Candlestick</i> (<a href="#pl_11">Pl. XI</a>, Fig. 9), which holds a
candle, and may be driven into the side or bottom of a
gallery.</p>

<p><i>Miner’s Lamps</i> (<a href="#pl_11">Pl. XI</a>, Fig. 10), can be used only
when the ventilation is good, as they give off more
smoke than candles.</p>

<p>When an electric-light plant is available, incandescent
lamps will be used for mining.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span></p>

<p><i>Earth Augers</i>, similar to those used for boring
post-holes, but of different diameters, are sometimes
used for placing camouflets. Their shanks are made
in short lengths, which can be joined together to allow
of boring a deep hole from a narrow shaft or gallery.</p>

<p>Great galleries are used for descent into a ditch, and
when it is wished to pass cannon through them.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a></p>

<p>Common galleries are used for descent into a ditch,
and for communications. Troops can pass through
them “by twos.”</p>

<p>Half galleries answer for general purposes of attack.
They allow the miner to work freely in different positions
without being cramped, but are small enough to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
admit of rapid driving. Branches and small branches
are driven out from the galleries to the mine-chambers,
etc. They can be driven rapidly for short distances
(10 to 20 feet); but when of greater length the earth is
removed from them with difficulty, they are not easily
ventilated, and are too small for use as communications.</p>

<p id="II_art20"><b>20. Shaft and Gallery Linings.</b>&mdash;In very firm soil
it is sometimes practicable to drive small shafts and
galleries short distances without lining them; but if
these are to stand for any length of time, there is always
danger of their falling in, particularly if shaken
by the explosion of mines in their vicinity. When it
is considered safe to use them, however, the shafts
should be elliptical in plan, and the roofs of the galleries
should be pointed arches. As a rule, however, both
shafts and galleries should be lined. Those which are
permanent in their character&mdash;as the main galleries of
the countermines of a permanent work&mdash;are lined with
masonry. Masonry linings may be of brick, stone, or
concrete walls and arches. The smaller galleries constructed
during a siege, and all the shafts and galleries
of the attack, are lined with wood. Wooden linings are
of two general types, known as <i>cases</i>, and <i>frames and
sheeting</i>.</p>

<p id="II_art21"><b>21.</b> <i>Cases</i> (<a href="#pl_11">Pl. XI</a>, Figs. 11 and 12) are made of plank,
from 6" to 12" wide, each case consisting of a cap-sill, a
ground-sill, and two stanchions. The cap and ground-sills
are cut to a length equal to the clear width of the
shaft or gallery plus twice the thickness of the stanchions;
a rectangular notch is cut in each end to receive
a corresponding tenon cut on the stanchion.
The length of the stanchions between shoulders is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
equal to the clear length of the shaft or height of the
gallery. The length of the tenons is generally equal
to the thickness of the cap and ground sill (usually 2´´),
and their width about three inches. Notches are cut
in the sides of all the pieces of the case, as shown in
the figure, for convenience in handling them.</p>

<p>In grand galleries the tenons at the top of the stanchions
are usually shorter than the thickness of the cap-sill,
and those at the bottom, as well as the mortises in
the ground-sill, are omitted. The stanchions are kept
from collapsing by blocks nailed to the ground-sills.
These blocks are 2" thick, and wide enough (about 9´´)
to so guide the wheels of a gun-carriage as to prevent
the axle striking the stanchions.</p>

<p>In cases for smaller galleries also the tenons are
sometimes omitted at the bottom of the stanchions,
the mortises in the ground-sills cut an inch or two
deeper, and the stanchions kept from collapsing by
keys driven in the mortises (<a href="#pl_11">Pl. XI</a>, Fig. 13).</p>

<p id="II_art22"><b>22. Shaft and Gallery Frames</b> (<a href="#pl_11">Pl. XI</a>, Figs. 14,
15, and 16) are made of scantlings, halved together at
the ends, as shown in the figures. <i>Sheeting</i> is made of
boards or planks of the necessary thickness, sawn to
proper lengths, and bevelled at the ends. When
sawn lumber is not available, the frames may be made
of saplings, and in some cases poles may be used for
sheeting.</p>

<p>The middle of each cap and ground sill, both in
frames and cases, is distinctly marked by a shallow saw
cut or otherwise.</p>

<p>The cases of branches and small branches are sometimes
made very strong, with a view to resist rupture
by the explosion of neighboring mines. For this purpose
cases made of oak plank 4" thick are used, and the
branch near its end is packed full of scantlings provided
with rope-handles at their ends for withdrawing
them after the mine is fired. This packing is, however,
of doubtful utility, since a compression of the case sufficient
to call the resistance of the packing into play is
very apt to produce a permanent deformation of the
cases, which will jam the scantlings and prevent their
removal. For convenience in use the pieces of cases
should be of uniform width.</p>

<p id="II_art24"><b>24. Relative Advantages of Cases, and Frames
and Sheeting.</b>&mdash;In favorable soil, cases, when they can
be obtained, allow of more rapid progress and give a
lining with a smooth interior. In very bad soil they
cannot be used for the larger galleries.</p>

<p>Frames and sheeting can be used in all soils which
admit of mining operations, and can usually be improvised
from materials found in the vicinity.</p>

<p id="II_art25"><b>25. Sinking a Shaft by Frames and Sheeting.</b>&mdash;The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
size and position of a shaft are usually determined
by the character and direction of the gallery which is
to start out from it. It is evident (<a href="#pl_11">Pl. XI</a>, Fig. 17) that
the clear width of the shaft must be enough greater
than the outside width of the gallery to allow the side
sheeting of the gallery to be freely inserted outside the
frames of the gallery and inside those of the shaft; also,
that the shaft frames must be so spaced as to leave a
clear space at the bottom for the gallery. This space
must be equal to the clear height of the gallery, increased
by the thickness of the cap-sill, the sheeting,
and one or two inches for easy working. This and the
thickness of one frame being deducted from the depth
of the shaft, the remainder may be divided up into a
number of equal or unequal parts called <i>shaft intervals</i>.
In order that the sheeting may not yield under the pressure
of the earth, these intervals seldom exceed 4 feet.</p>

<p>The length of the shaft must be great enough to allow
the miners to work freely, and to insert the sheeting
for the first gallery interval.</p>

<p>The sheeting for both shafts and galleries is cut in
lengths about 1 foot greater than the interval between
frame centres.</p>

<p id="II_art26"><b>26.</b> The size and position of the shaft having been
fixed, the top frame (<a href="#pl_11">Pl. XI</a>, Fig. 15) is placed in position
and secured by pegs, and the direction of its axis is accurately
fixed by the score marks at the middle of the
end pieces. The side and end pieces of this frame are
respectively about 3 feet longer than those of the other
frames, and are so halved together as to make of their
ends four projecting <i>horns</i>, 1½' long, which keep the
frame in place during the excavation of the first interval.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span></p>

<p>This frame is usually placed with its top flush with
the surface of the ground. The miner proceeds to excavate
the shaft with pick and shovel, making it large
enough in plan to admit the sheeting outside the frame.
Usually the first interval can be excavated without supporting
the earth at the sides, which are vertical or
slightly undercut, so that at the bottom of the interval
the shaft will be large enough to admit the second
frame, the sheeting of the first interval, and a system
of wedges which hold this sheeting out from the second
frame a distance somewhat greater than the thickness
of the sheeting of the second interval. The verticality
of the sides is determined by the plumb-line, and the
size of the shaft by two gauge-sticks cut respectively
to the outside length and width of the excavation, and
distinctly marked at their centres.</p>

<p>To avoid the inconvenience of working under the top
frame, the first interval is frequently marked out and
excavated before the frame is fixed in its position.</p>

<p>When the shaft is deep enough the second frame is
put in place and nailed together; the notches in the
ends of the side pieces turned upward and those of the
end pieces downward. The top and second frame are
connected by nailing to them four battens of proper
length (two on each side), which suspend the second
frame from the top frame at the established interval.
The second frame is placed vertically below the top
frame by using the plumb-line and the scores in the
frames.</p>

<p>The sheeting is inserted outside the top frame, bevelled
end first, bevel outside, and pushed down until its top
is flush with the top frame. The lower end of the
sheeting is held out from the lower frame by suitable
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
wedges, and the excavation of the second interval is
commenced.</p>

<p>In ordinary soil the sides of the shaft will now require
support. Sheeting is therefore introduced and pushed
down as the excavation proceeds, and the wedges previously
placed are removed to make room for the sheeting.</p>

<p id="II_art27"><b>27.</b> If the pressure of the earth becomes great enough
to spring the sheeting-planks inward, an <i>auxiliary frame</i>
is introduced. This is a frame similar to the shaft
frames, but from 4 to 6 inches larger in outside dimensions.</p>

<p>The sheeting rests directly against the outside of this
frame, and is thus held out far enough to allow the third
frame to be placed and the wedges to be inserted as before.</p>

<p>The auxiliary frame is then removed and used in the
next interval.</p>

<p id="II_art28"><b>28.</b> Successive frames are placed in the same manner
until the one directly over the gallery is reached.
Great care is taken to place this frame at exactly the
right height, and the shaft is then continued to the required
depth. A frame is placed at the bottom with
its top at the level of the floor of the gallery, and the
sheeting is allowed to rest directly against the outside
of this frame. When the soil will allow it, the sheeting
is omitted wholly or in part over the portion of the
shaft which is to form the gallery entrance.</p>

<p id="II_art29"><b>29. Precautions.</b>&mdash;In sinking shafts especial care
must be taken to make the excavation no larger than
is required for placing the lining, since if a vacant
space is left outside the lining the sides of the shaft
may give way through its entire height, and fall against
the lining with a blow which will crush it in.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span></p>

<p><i>This is often the cause of fatal accidents both in shafts
and galleries.</i></p>

<p id="II_art30"><b>30. Partly-lined Shafts</b>, i.e., those in which the
sheeting-planks are separated from each other by
greater or less intervals, should only be used for small
depths and when they are expected to stand for a very
short time.</p>

<p>They are a constant menace to the miners, owing to
the danger of their caving in, and in a much greater
degree to the probability of stones, etc., falling from
the unprotected parts and seriously injuring or killing
the men at the bottom.</p>

<p id="II_art31"><b>31. Driving a Gallery with Frames and Sheeting.</b>&mdash;The
direction of the gallery has already been marked
by the scores on the shaft frames; but it must be verified
by plumb-lines, and two small pickets be driven on
the line of its axis, which is located exactly by small
nails, one driven in the head of each picket.</p>

<p>Two gauge-rods are prepared, giving the extreme
height and breadth of the excavation, i.e., the height
of the frame plus two thicknesses of top sheeting, and
the breadth of the frame plus four thicknesses of side
sheeting. The middle of each gauge-rod is also plainly
marked.</p>

<p>A gallery frame is set up against the side of the shaft
(<a href="#pl_11">Pl. XI</a>, Fig. 17), its ground-sill flush with the bottom
frame of the shaft; or its stanchions may rest upon
the shaft frame as a ground-sill.</p>

<p>The gallery frame is carefully located and fastened in
position with battens and braces. The shaft sheeting
is then forced down two or three inches with a bar, and
the top sheeting of the gallery inserted and driven in
until its end is supported by the earth. It is given the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
proper upward pitch by a scantling laid across it and
secured to the shaft frames. The shaft sheeting is
forced further down, the earth at the top excavated,
and the top gallery sheeting advanced. As this work
proceeds the side sheeting-planks are successively inserted
and driven forward.</p>

<p>In this way the gallery is advanced one gallery interval,
usually about 4 feet, when a second frame is
placed. Its position is verified by the score marks;
for direction, by a line; for grade, by a spirit, mason’s,
or field level; and for verticality, by a plumb-line. It is
then secured in place by nailing battens to it and the
preceding frame. Wedges are inserted between the
frame and the sheeting, and the gallery is continued by
the same methods (<a href="#pl_12">Pl. XII</a>, Fig. 19). When the sheeting
is advanced only by hard driving the frames are
slightly inclined to the rear at first, and are afterwards
driven forward until vertical.</p>

<p id="II_art32"><b>32.</b> If, while advancing the sheeting, the pressure
upon it becomes so great as to spring it, a <i>false frame</i> (<a href="#pl_12">Pl.
XII</a>, Fig. 18) must be used. This consists of a cap-sill,
ground-sill, and two stanchions, connected by mortises
and tenons. The stanchions have tenons and the sills
mortises at each end. The cap-sill is usually rounded
on top and, for facility in setting up and removing, its
mortises are longer than the width of the tenons.
The latter are held in place by wedges when the frame
is in position. The false frame is usually made of the
same height as the common frames and, when side
sheeting is used, wider by twice the thickness of this
sheeting. When side sheeting is not used, its outside
width may be equal to the clear width of the gallery.</p>

<p>In using the frame (<a href="#pl_12">Pl. XII</a>, Fig. 19) the ground-sill is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
first placed accurately in position at a half interval in advance,
the stanchions are set up, and the cap-sill placed
upon them and wedged. The whole frame is then
raised about 2 inches by folding wedges placed under
each end of the ground-sill, and is secured by battens.
The sheeting will now rest directly upon the cap-sill
and stanchions, and have the proper inclination to clear
the next frame by its own thickness, as is required.</p>

<p>The next frame is then set up, the wedges driven
under the sheeting, and the false frame removed; which
is easily done, owing to its construction.</p>

<p id="II_art33"><b>33.</b> When the soil is very bad a <i>shield</i> (<a href="#pl_12">Pl. XII</a>, Fig. 20)
is used to prevent the earth in front and above from
caving into the gallery. In starting out from the shaft
the following method is adopted: As soon as the top
sheeting is sufficiently advanced and the shaft sheeting
is forced down about 1 foot, the top plank of the side
sheeting is inserted and driven forward about 2 feet, and
the earth at the top of the gallery is excavated for from
6 inches to 1 foot in advance. A piece of plank a foot
wide and in length equal to the width of the gallery is
then placed directly under the top sheeting and against
the face of the excavation, and is held in place by braces
at its ends secured to the shaft lining. The shaft sheeting
is then lowered another foot, the next plank of the
side sheeting inserted, the earth excavated, and a
second plank of the shield placed in the same way as
before. This is continued until the entire face is covered.
The top and side sheeting are then driven forward,
and the top plank of the shield is removed and replaced
in advance; after which each plank is removed
and replaced in succession, as above described.</p>

<p id="II_art34"><b>34. Inclined Galleries.</b>&mdash;<i>Method of fixing the slope.</i>&mdash;If
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
the gallery instead of being horizontal is <i>ascending</i>
(<a href="#pl_12">Pl. XII</a>, Fig. 21) or <i>descending</i> (Fig. 22), the proper slope
is obtained by using a <i>slope-block</i> whose edge is equal to
the rise or fall of the gallery in one interval. This is
placed upon the lower of two consecutive ground-sills,
and the proper height of the other is determined by a
mason’s or spirit level (Fig. 21). If a field-level or
a mason’s level properly marked for the slope is used,
the slope-block may be dispensed with (Fig. 22).</p>

<p id="II_art35"><b>35. Position of Frames.</b>&mdash;In driving <i>descending galleries</i>
better progress will be made and less material used
if the frames are set at right angles to the axis of the gallery
(<a href="#pl_12">Pl. XII</a>, Fig. 22); and this is the usual custom. In
driving <i>ascending galleries</i> this is impracticable, and the
frames are set vertically (Fig. 21). In all other respects
inclined galleries are driven in the same manner as
horizontal ones.</p>

<p id="II_art36"><b>36. Partly-lined Galleries.</b>&mdash;In very firm soil side
sheeting may be omitted entirely, and in that less firm
the side planks need not be in contact. When the side
sheeting is omitted the width of excavation may be reduced
to the clear width of the gallery, and the stanchions
be let into the side wall flush with its surface.
In this case the ground-sills are frequently omitted, the
stanchions resting upon wooden blocks, stones,or directly
upon the earth.</p>

<p>To save material, the planks of the top sheeting are
sometimes more or less separated also. This can only
be recommended when rapid and temporary work is
required with limited materials; and in these cases the
earth between the planks should be supported by a
packing of sticks, brush, etc., etc.</p>

<p id="II_art37"><b>37. Change of Direction in Galleries.</b>&mdash;In changing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
the direction of a gallery, the new direction is laid off
by using a carefully made angle-templet (<a href="#pl_11">Pl. XI</a>, Fig. 7)
or slope-block, field-level, etc., and it is prolonged in
the new direction by the methods already described.
When the soil is firm enough to stand safely while excavating
and lining one gallery interval, even if somewhat
short, no difficulty exists in changing the direction of a
gallery in either a vertical or horizontal plane, since the
excavation in the new direction may be made so large
that the miner working in it can place the new frames
and introduce the sheeting and wedges. The gallery
can then be carried on without diminution in size.</p>

<p>When the soil is bad, however, special arrangements
must be made for introducing the sheeting.</p>

<p id="II_art38"><b>38. Change of Slope.</b>&mdash;To pass from a horizontal to
an <i>ascending</i> gallery (<a href="#pl_12">Pl. XII</a>, Fig. 21) it is only necessary
to give the top sheeting the proper angle by holding
down its back end with a piece of scantling placed
across the gallery for that purpose; and, to give the side
sheeting the proper inclination, cutting trenches in the
bottom of the gallery for the lower pieces, if necessary.</p>

<p>In passing from a horizontal to a <i>descending</i> gallery
(<a href="#pl_12">Pl. XII</a>, Fig. 22) the roof may be carried forward horizontally,
and the floor given the desired pitch by increasing
the height of the consecutive frames, until
enough head-room is obtained to allow the top sheeting
for the descending gallery to be inserted at the proper
height and angle. The frame at this point is made with
a cap-sill (upon which the sheeting rests directly), and
a second cross-piece below it, serving as a cap-sill for
the descending gallery. From this point forward the
frames may be set perpendicular to the axis of the gallery,
as previously stated.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span></p>

<p>If the descending gallery is very steep and the horizontal
pressure of the soil great, it may be necessary to
strengthen the stanchions of the last two or three vertical
frames by cross-pieces near their upper ends.</p>

<p id="II_art39"><b>39. Change of Direction Horizontally.</b>&mdash;Slight changes
of direction of narrow galleries, either to right or
left, may be made in a manner entirely similar to that
above described for descending galleries, by widening
the frames until the side sheeting can be inserted at the
required angle, and strengthening the cap-sills, when necessary,
with additional stanchions.</p>

<p>When the gallery is wide or the changes of direction
abrupt, however, it is customary to drive the gallery
entirely beyond the turning-point, and then break out
a gallery in the new direction from the side of the original
gallery.</p>

<p id="II_art40"><b>40. Returns.</b>&mdash;A gallery starting out from the side
of another is called a <i>return</i>, and is <i>rectangular</i> or <i>oblique</i>
according to the angle made by its axis with that of the
original gallery, which is called the <i>gallery of departure</i>.</p>

<p>That the return may be broken out, the interval between
the frames of the gallery of departure at this
point must be such as to admit between the stanchions
a frame and the side sheeting of the return (<a href="#pl_12">Pl. XII</a>,
Fig. 23). This part of the gallery of departure is called
a <i>landing</i>, and its floor is made horizontal.</p>

<p>If the return is oblique (Fig. 24), its width measured
along the gallery of departure will be determined by
an oblique section, and may be so great that the strength
of the lining of the gallery of departure will not allow
the necessary length of landing. In this case a short
rectangular return is first broken out from the side of
the gallery of departure, and the new gallery is broken
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
out from the side of this return (Fig. 25). The latter
method diminishes the length of the landing when the
change of direction is less than 45°.</p>

<p id="II_art41"><b>41.</b> The floor of a return is started at the level of the
floor of its landing. In firm soils which will stand for a
short time without support the first frame may be set
up entirely outside the gallery of departure (<a href="#pl_12">Pl. XII</a>,
Figs. 24 and 25) and may be of the same height in clear
as this gallery. When the soil is bad, however, and side
sheeting is required in the gallery of departure, the first
frame of the return must be set up against this sheeting
in the interval between the stanchions of the landing
(Fig. 23). This makes the clear height of the return at
this frame less than that of the gallery of departure by
a little more than the thickness of the sheeting.</p>

<p>The first frame of an oblique return should be so
made that the sides of the stanchions will be parallel to
the side walls of the return, thus giving a good bearing
to the side sheeting.</p>

<p>In very bad soil, the first few frames of a return must
be firmly braced to resist the backward thrust of the
earth, by battens connecting them together and by
struts across the gallery of departure. The latter are
removed when the return is sufficiently advanced.</p>

<p id="II_art42"><b>42. A Complete Map</b> must be made of every system
of mines, showing the centres of shafts, and the
axes and slopes of all galleries; giving also the references
and lengths of all landings, and the locations,
references, and dimensions of all mine chambers.</p>

<p id="II_art43"><b>43. Working Drawings</b> must also be made from
which sheeting can be cut to proper lengths and angle-templets,
etc., cut and framed.</p>

<p>These can be easily and accurately drawn by remembering
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
that, to allow the miners to insert the sheeting,
every return must have such dimensions outside its
sheeting that, if it were free to move, its lining could
be slid back across its landing as a drawer slides in
a table. The size of the landings and dimensions of
frames having thus been determined, the parts of the
galleries between them may be divided into intervals,
which, for convenience, should be equal, since this will
allow the sheeting to be cut to a uniform length.</p>

<p id="II_art44"><b>44. Sinking a Shaft with Cases.</b>&mdash;(<a href="#pl_12">Pl. XII</a>, Figs.
26 and 27.)&mdash;A case of the required size is put together
and accurately placed upon the site of the shaft, whose
dimensions are marked upon the ground outside it.
The case is then removed and the earth excavated to
the depth of the case, which is placed in the excavation
with its top flush with the surface of the ground. Its
position is carefully verified, and it is secured in position
by packing earth around it. The excavation is
then continued for the depth of another case, which is
put in place as follows, viz.:</p>

<p>One end piece is placed in position, the tenons of the
two side pieces are inserted in the mortises at its ends,
and the side pieces are pushed back into position; a
pocket-shaped excavation is made with a push-pick
beyond the end of one of the side pieces and running
back three or four inches into the side wall; the remaining
end piece is inserted in this far enough to allow the
mortise at its other end to slip over its corresponding
tenon; it is then drawn back, and the tenons at
both ends fitted into their mortises. The notches cut
in the sides of the pieces allow them to be easily
handled.</p>

<p>The next case is placed in the same way, care being
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
taken not to excavate two consecutive pockets at the
same angle.</p>

<p>When practicable, it is well to fill up these pockets
by stuffing in sods from below before placing the next
case.</p>

<p>Some miners prefer to place one tenoned piece first,
then the two mortised pieces, leaving a wedge-shaped
opening behind one of them, and insert the other
tenoned piece last, drawing the mortised piece forward
upon its tenon.</p>

<p>When the sides of the cases are tenoned at one end
only and secured by wedges at the other, they are easily
placed in position without cutting out behind them.</p>

<p id="II_art45"><b>45.</b> Upon reaching the level of the top of the gallery,
the pieces on the gallery side of the shaft are omitted
if the ground is firm, but if it needs support these
pieces are put in place and secured by cleats or braces,
but the tenons are not inserted in the mortises.</p>

<p id="II_art46"><b>46. Driving a Gallery with Cases</b> (<a href="#pl_12">Pl. XII</a>, Fig.
27).&mdash;This is practicable only when the soil is somewhat
firm. In breaking out from the side of the shaft,
a frame is first placed inside the shaft to support the
ends of the shaft cases resting against the pieces which
are to be removed. The latter pieces are then taken
out and grooves are cut in the earth for the ground-sill,
stanchions, and cap-sill of the gallery, and these are
put in place in a manner entirely analogous to that described
for sinking a shaft. This case is set flush with
the inside of the shaft and supports the side pieces,
whose tenons rest upon its stanchions. The projecting
earth is then cut away and grooves are cut for the next
case, which is placed in position and the excavation
continued as before.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span></p>

<p id="II_art47"><b>47.</b> When the earth shows a tendency to cave, which
it frequently will in great galleries, the cap-sill must
be put in position and supported while the miner excavates
the grooves for the ground-sill and stanchions.</p>

<p>To support the cap-sill, two crutches are used. A
<i>crutch</i> (<a href="#pl_12">Pl. XII</a>, Fig. 28) consists of an upright piece of
timber carrying a cross-piece whose length is equal to the
width of two cases. The upright piece rests upon the
ground-sill of the case already placed, and is raised to
the proper height by wedges. The part of the cross-piece
which projects in advance is made 2 inches higher
than the rear part, to support the cap-sill somewhat
above its final level, so as to allow the tenons of the
stanchions to be easily inserted. The rear part of the
cross-piece is attached to the upright by an iron rod or
short chain.</p>

<p>So soon as the case is set and adjusted to position
the crutches are taken down by removing the wedges,
and are replaced under the next cap-sill.</p>

<p id="II_art48"><b>48.</b> In very firm soil shafts and galleries are frequently
driven with cases not in juxtaposition, but separated
by greater or less intervals. Pieces of planks
(which may be parts of cases) placed vertically and
resting against the sides and ends of the cases in
shafts, or horizontally and resting upon the cap-sills in
galleries, and somewhat separated from each other, are
used to support the earth between the cases.</p>

<p>The same remarks apply to this construction as to
the similar one sometimes used when mining with
frames and sheeting.</p>

<p id="II_art49"><b>49. Change of Direction in Galleries Lined with
Cases.</b>&mdash;Slight changes in direction in a horizontal
plane can be easily and gradually made by setting
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
each case a little obliquely to the one preceding it,
and separating the stanchions on one side while they
touch on the other, supporting the roof in the wedge-shaped
openings, if necessary, with pieces of wood, etc.
For an abrupt change, it is better to break out a rectangular
return from the side of the gallery and pass
from this into the required direction by gradual
change.</p>

<p>If the return is to be of the same height as the gallery
of departure, the cap-sills of the latter, for a distance
equal to the width of the return, are lifted off the
tenons of the stanchions by struts and wedges, and the
first case of the return is set as in breaking out from
a shaft; the ground-sill is, however, narrowed by the
thickness of the stanchions of the gallery of departure
so that the face of the case of the return is flush with
the inside of the gallery of departure, and the ends of
the cap-sills of the latter rest upon the cap-sill of the
first case of the return.</p>

<p id="II_art50"><b>50. Change of Slope.</b>&mdash;In passing from a horizontal
to a <i>descending gallery</i> the change may be made gradually,
in a manner similar to that described for a change
in horizontal direction, and the cases remain normal to
the axis of the gallery. (<a href="#pl_12">Pl. XII</a>, Fig. 31.)</p>

<p>To pass to an <i>ascending gallery</i> by the method above
described would require the earth at the face of the
gallery to be undercut in order to introduce the case,
and this undercutting would be continued so long as
the cases were normal to the axis of the gallery. This
construction is, as a rule, impracticable. In ascending
galleries, therefore, the cases are set with their stanchions
vertical, while their cap and ground sills lie in
the slope of the roof and floor of the gallery.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span></p>

<p id="II_art51"><b>51.</b> To conform with this requirement, and for convenience
in setting up, the ends of the stanchions
receive the proper bevel, while the sides of the tenons
and mortises are made parallel to the sides of the
stanchions. (<a href="#pl_12">Pl. XII</a>, Fig. 12.)</p>

<p id="II_art52"><b>52. Shafts à la Boule.</b>&mdash;In order to place a charge
of explosive directly under the ground occupied, or for
other reasons, it is frequently necessary to sink a small
shaft in the least possible time. For this purpose a
modified form of cases is sometimes used, in which the
ends are halved together instead of being tenoned
and mortised. (<a href="#pl_12">Pl. XII</a>, Fig. 29.) They are spaced at
greater or less distances apart, according to the nature
of the ground, and are connected together by battens.
Stones, pieces of wood, etc., etc., are driven between
them and the sides of the shaft to support the latter.</p>

<p>This construction is called a shaft à la Boule. It is
expected to stand for a few days at most. Many other
extemporized linings may be used for similar purposes.</p>

<p id="II_art53"><b>53. Blinded Galleries.</b>&mdash;Galleries cannot be successfully
driven with less than 3 to 3½ feet of undisturbed
earth over their sheeting. In making a descent into a
ditch, or in pushing forward an approach in siege
operations, it is often impracticable to lower the bottom
of the trench of departure sufficiently to give the
requisite cover for starting a gallery at once. In these
cases <i>blinded descents</i> or <i>galleries</i> may be used, the tops
and sides of which are supported by <i>blindage-frames</i>,
or <i>blinds</i>, each of which consists of two side parts of
4" × 6" scantling 9' long, united by two cross-pieces of
the same section 3' 8" long, which are mortised or
halved into them, leaving horns at each end 1' long.
(<a href="#pl_12">Pl. XII</a>, Fig. 30.)
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span></p>

<p id="II_art54"><b>54.</b> The galleries are constructed as follows (<a href="#pl_12">Pl. XII</a>,
Fig. 31): A double sap with a width of 8' is broken out
from the side of the trench in the direction required and
is driven forward in the usual manner, but with a continual
increase in depth, at a slope not exceeding ¼.
The side slopes are as steep as the earth will allow.
Two blindage-frames are set up vertically on the sides
of the sap, 7' apart in clear, with their tops at the level
of the tops of the trench gabions, their bottom horns
resting in holes dug for them. These frames are prevented
from falling inward by another frame placed
crosswise upon them, with its horns resting on their
cross-pieces. The side of this top frame toward the
front may be held up by a stake or crutch, and the
second pair of frames be placed at such an interval that
their horns will interlock with those of the top frame.
Successive frames may be placed in the same manner.
The covering or “roof” is formed by three or four
layers of fascines placed across the trench on top of
the frames, and covered with earth thrown back upon
them as the work proceeds. The sides of the gallery
are held up by fascines, etc., laid along outside the
frames.</p>

<p>As soon as the bottom of the blinded gallery has
reached the proper depth a mine-gallery may be started
and carried forward.</p>

<p id="II_art55"><b>55.</b> The blindage-frames described above give to
the gallery a clear width and height of 7'. For smaller
galleries the blinds may all be made shorter and of
lighter scantling; or, if desired, those for the sides may
be of a different length from those for the top.</p>

<h3 id="VENTILATION_OF_MINES">VENTILATION OF MINES.</h3>

<p id="II_art57"><b>57.</b> The gases resulting from firing mines and from
the lamps, bodies, and candles of the miners so vitiate
the air in galleries that, unless means for ventilating
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
them are adopted, the miners must eventually abandon
them or become asphyxiated.</p>

<p>In ordinary circumstances, when no powder gases
are present, a gallery cannot be driven safely more
than 60 feet without ventilation.</p>

<p>The measures adopted for ventilating galleries consist,
1st, in forcing in fresh air; 2d, in drawing out foul
air; and, 3d, in assisting the natural diffusion and circulation
of the air through them.</p>

<p id="II_art58"><b>58.</b> The first is accomplished by forcing air through
pipes, which may be of tin, wood, or common hose,
leading to the point where ventilation is required.
The air is forced in by the use of the miner’s bellows
or other apparatus already described. This method is
simple in its application and places the fresh air where
it is needed, but drives the foul air back into the galleries
occupied by other miners. It is the only practicable
method of ventilating single, long, narrow galleries
and branches.</p>

<p id="II_art59"><b>59.</b> The second method may be applied to a system
consisting of a number of galleries connected by transversals,
by so placing an exhausting fan as to draw the
air out through one gallery, while by light wooden or
canvas doors and screens the other galleries are so
arranged that the fresh air, entering from the exterior,
sweeps through the galleries occupied by the miners,
and escapes through the unoccupied gallery leading to
the fan, carrying the gases with it.</p>

<p>In this method a single large gallery may be ventilated
by using a canvas partition placed near the top or
on one side, so that the fresh air will go in on one side
around the end of the partition and back by the other
side to the fan.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span></p>

<p>This method has the advantage of carrying the gases
away from the galleries occupied by the men, and supplying
fresh air throughout those which are occupied.</p>

<p>The exhaust may be produced by a fire constantly
burning at the foot of a shaft instead of by a fan.</p>

<p>The method is, however, complicated in its application,
and can seldom be used for military mines.</p>

<p id="II_art60"><b>60.</b> The third method, or assisting natural ventilation,
is carried out by cutting numerous cross-galleries
connecting those which are near each other, by making
air-shafts and bore-holes connecting the galleries with
the surface of the ground, and, when practicable, by
placing the openings of the shafts and galleries at different
levels. This method will serve for a few men
working leisurely in preparing countermines before an
attack, but is entirely inadequate during active mining
operations.</p>

<p id="II_art61"><b>61.</b> By the use of masks covering the face, and supplied
with fresh air either through hose or from a reservoir
of compressed air carried with him, a miner may
work in galleries in which the air is irrespirable. The
advantages which may frequently result from the time
thus saved justify providing apparatus of this kind for
use in mining operations.</p>

<h3>MINE-CHAMBERS.</h3>

<p id="II_art62"><b>62. Mine-chambers</b> to contain the charge of explosive
are preferably nearly cubical in form, and if not
charged at once, or if of large size, must have sufficient
lining to support the roof and sides.</p>

<p>When they are above the level of the gallery they
are arranged to drain into it. They are made large
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
enough to contain the receptacle for the charge and to
allow the charge to be placed in it. They are, as a rule,
placed in short returns at one side of the branch or gallery,
but may be at its end, above or below it. The mine-chamber
frequently consists of so much of the end of
the gallery as is necessary to contain the charge.</p>

<h3 id="LOADING_AND_FIRING_MINES">LOADING AND FIRING MINES.</h3>

<p id="II_art63"><b>63. Preparing the Charge.</b>&mdash;The weight of the
charge necessary to produce the desired effect is determined
by the rules previously given. Its volume, if of
powder or compressed gun-cotton, may be found by
allowing 30 cubic inches to the pound; and if of dynamite,
about 20 cubic inches.</p>

<p>If the mine-chamber is perfectly dry, and the mine
is to be fired at once, a layer of straw may be placed
upon the floor of the chamber and the charge contained
in canvas bags laid upon it. When the ground is more
or less wet, or when the mine is not to be fired immediately,
the charge should have a water-proof covering,
which may be a thoroughly calked and pitched box, an
ale-barrel or beer-keg, the metal barrels in which powder
is shipped, or India-rubber or pitched-canvas bags,&mdash;depending
upon the amount of moisture present and
the time that the charge is to remain in place. Many
of the high explosives are not affected by dampness,
and but little if any by water; but to secure the fuse
and its connections from injury, and to remove all danger
of misfires, the explosive should in all cases be
protected from water if practicable.</p>

<p id="II_art64"><b>64. Distribution of Fuses in the Charges.</b>&mdash;Gunpowder
will explode with full effect if ignited, but to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
prevent the explosion of the central part of a large
charge scattering the exterior portion before it is ignited
a number of fuzes should be used. They may
convey fire only, but must all be ignited by the firing
apparatus, and simultaneously. One fuze to each 100
lbs. of powder is not too great an allowance; but when
lack of time or appliances does not admit of placing a
number of fuzes, the desired effect may be obtained by
increasing the charge of powder and using one fuze.
(See Abbot, Prof. Papers Corps of Engineers, No. 23,
1881, p. 62, for number of fuzes needed; and pp. 244-51
for simultaneous ignitions.)</p>

<p>The high explosives detonate with full force only
when exploded with a detonating fuze. Under favorable
conditions one fuze will detonate a very large charge,
but cases arise in which a portion of the charge explodes
and the remainder does not. To insure the best results,
therefore, it is desirable to distribute fuzes throughout
a large charge, at the rate of perhaps one fuze to each
50 lbs. These fuzes should contain from 20 to 30 grains
of fulminate of mercury, which is itself very sensitive
to shock, and has in a high degree the power of detonating
the other explosives. One fuze only (or, for
safety against defects, two or three) need be connected
with the firing apparatus, the others serving to reinforce
and carry on the wave of explosion after it is started&mdash;differing
in this respect from their use with charges of
gunpowder.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span></p>

<p id="II_art65"><b>65. Character and Construction of Fuzes.</b>&mdash;Formerly,
for firing mines, trains of powders put up in linen
tubes, quick-match, and other similar devices were
used. Electric-blasting apparatus is now in such common
use that it will always be available for any extended
mining operations. For single mines with small charges
it may, however, be necessary sometimes to resort to
the older method of firing, the apparatus for which can
be readily improvised. But even in these cases “Bickford”
or “Safety” fuze will usually be available, and
may be used alone for firing gunpowder, or with a common
fulminate-of-mercury “blasting-cap” for high explosives.
It burns at the rate of about 4 feet per minute.
Very quick-burning fuzes are also made which
may be used at times (e. g., <i>Bickford Instantaneous</i>,
which burns at the rate of 120 feet a second; <i>Gomez
Lightning</i>, which burns so rapidly that it may almost be
said to detonate; etc.) Great care must be taken not
to mistake them for the common Bickford.</p>

<p id="II_art66"><b>66. Electric Fuzes</b> are made of three general classes:
First, those which are fired by a spark from a high-tension
machine; second, those which are ignited by a current
from a battery or “dynamo;” third, those which
can be fired by either. (Abels, etc.)</p>

<p id="II_art67"><b>67.</b> Those of the second class are manufactured in
large quantities, and, in connection with a portable dynamo
or “blasting-battery,” are almost universally used
for blasting operations throughout the United States.</p>

<p>These fuzes (<a href="#pl_12">Pl. XII</a>, Fig. 32) are made up of two
insulated copper wires, <i>A</i>, <i>A</i>, passing through a small
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
cylindrical block of insulating material, <i>B</i>, and terminating
about <sup>1</sup>/<sub>16</sub> inch above its end. A very fine platinum
wire, <i>C</i>, about <sup>1</sup>/<sub>1000</sub> inch in diameter and <sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub> inch long,
connects the ends of the insulated wires. Surrounding
the platinum wire is a small quantity of gun-cotton,
mealed powder, or fulminate of mercury, <i>D</i>. A copper
capsule containing 15 to 30 grains of fulminate of mercury,
<i>E</i>, is pressed down over the cylindrical block far
enough to bring the fulminate in contact with the
material surrounding the platinum wire, and the whole
fuze is then coated with a water-proof composition. The
insulated copper wires are cut to various lengths for
convenience in connecting with the conductors or lead
wires from the battery.</p>

<p id="II_art68"><b>68.</b> Fuzes of the first and third classes are now but
little used. Many of them are unsatisfactory and dangerous.
They differ in construction from those of the
second class principally in that the platinum-wire bridge
is omitted, and the exploding spark or current passes
from one insulated copper wire to the other through a
material which is ignited by it.</p>

<p id="II_art69"><b>69. Placing the Fuses in the Charges.</b>&mdash;A certain
number of cartridges or packages should be selected,
each fuse inserted and well packed in the explosive,
and the wires or free end of the safety fuse brought
out through the opening, which should be made water-proof,
if necessary, by securely closing and thoroughly
pitching it. The wires or exterior part of the fuse
should then be securely fastened to the outside of the
cartridge, so that an accidental strain upon them will
not break the waterproofing or move the fuse from its
place. They are then coiled up and remain so until the
cartridge is placed in the general charge of the mine.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span></p>

<p id="II_art70"><b>70.</b> Several of the high explosives congeal at a temperature
above the freezing-point of water, and in this
state are less sensitive to shock, and explode with difficulty
if closely packed in cartridges as usually delivered
from the factories. They explode more readily when
in the form of a powder. When using them in cold
weather, therefore, each fuse should be put in a cartridge
loosely filled with the powdered explosive, or with
some high explosive not affected by cold. Others need
special primers to cause detonation. The fuses should,
of course, be placed in these primers.</p>

<p id="II_art71"><b>71. Placing the Charges.</b>&mdash;The charge is placed
in the mine-chambers, either in the dark, by light reflected
through the galleries, by closed lanterns carefully
placed and guarded, or, when practicable, by incandescent
electric lights. It is carried through low
and narrow galleries on men’s backs or in miner’s cars,
and should for this reason be put up in packages not
exceeding 50 lbs. in weight.</p>

<p>It is packed in the chamber with great care, and
under the immediate supervision of the responsible
officer. The packages containing the fuses are distributed
uniformly throughout the mass, and the wires
uncoiled and led back into the gallery, the free ends of
the two wires of each fuse having been previously
twisted together for safety against electric currents and
for identification.</p>

<p>These wires, which must be long enough to reach
through the tamping, are all collected together and led
back through it in a wooden or other conduit, which protects
them from injury while tamping the mine.</p>

<p>When electric lights are used, great care must be
taken to remove the light and all its conducting wires
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
before the wires of the fuses are uncoiled and laid
along the gallery.</p>

<p id="II_art72"><b>72. Tamping.</b>&mdash;Mines are tamped with sods and
earth, wood and earth, sand-bags, etc., etc.</p>

<p>When sods are used the branch is filled for about 3
feet with sods carefully laid and packed with the joints
filled with earth. About 3 feet of earth is solidly
packed against this, then alternate layers of sods and
earth until the desired length of tamping is obtained.
To tamp with wood and earth or sand-bags, a wooden
shield is first placed across the branch and firmly
braced; behind this, earth is solidly packed or sand-bags
carefully laid until the required length of tamping
is obtained. Sometimes a second shield is put up behind
the earth tamping, and firmly braced in position.
The strength of the tamping is also increased by pieces
of timber crossing each other diagonally, with their
ends resting against the sides of the branch. Sand-bags
make the best tamping, as they offer high resistance
and are easily placed and removed.</p>

<p>The tamping should have a length equal to at least
1½ times the line of least resistance of a common mine
corresponding to the charge, and if not of the best
quality, to twice this line.</p>

<p id="II_art73"><b>73. Firing Mines.</b>&mdash;If electric fuses are used the
main conductors or lead wires coiled upon a reel are
taken in and the ends properly joined to the fuse wires;
they are then led through the galleries, attached to
the battery, and fired at the designated instant. Under
no circumstances should the main lead wires be
connected to the battery or dynamo until everything is
ready for firing.</p>

<p>If a Bickford fuse is used its length is regulated to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
desired time of firing from its known rate of burning.
The miner lights the end and retires; the explosion
takes place approximately at the calculated time.
With the “Lightning Gomez” or similar fuses a length
reaching to the firing-point may be used. It is lighted
at the desired time, and burns with such rapidity that
for lengths not exceeding 300 or 400 feet the time of
burning is inappreciable.</p>

<p>Instead of using great lengths of these fuses, they
may be cut shorter and their ends be brought together
and inserted in a little mealed powder which is fired
by a piece of safety-fuse, slow match or port-fire, etc.,
long enough to give the miner time to retire to a safe
distance after igniting it.</p>

<p>Bickford fuse is best ignited by a piece of cotton
wicking soaked in oil and loosely tied around it. This,
when lighted, will burn through the covering and set
fire to the composition. By this device many fuses
may be ignited in a short time. A slow match or
“touch-paper” for igniting quick-burning fuses or powder-trains
may be made by soaking common paper in a
strong solution of nitre and drying it.</p>

<h3 id="CAMOUFLETS_BY_BORING">CAMOUFLETS BY BORING.</h3>

<p id="II_art74"><b>74.</b> In favorable soil a camouflet or small mine may
sometimes be placed and fired very quickly by the following
process:</p>

<p>A hole 2" to 3" in diameter and of the desired depth
is bored in the proper direction with an auger or boring-bar.
A cartridge containing from ½ lb. to 2 lbs. of
dynamite is pushed down to the bottom and fired. The
explosion increases the diameter of the hole somewhat
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
throughout, and obstructs it more or less with loose
earth. At the same time it enlarges the part near the
seat of the charge into a bottle-shaped cavity, whose
size varies with the charge used and the nature of the
soil. The hole is rapidly cleared out with a long-handled
scoop, the cavity filled with powder, primed,
and fired.</p>

<p>The enlargement made by the charges of dynamite
above given may contain from 50 to 100 lbs. of gunpowder
under favorable circumstances.</p>

<p id="II_art75"><b>75.</b> In stony soil this method becomes very difficult
if not impracticable; and when it can be used the preliminary
explosion of dynamite vitiates to a greater or
less degree the air of the shaft or gallery from which
the boring is made, and also informs the enemy of the
progress and intention of the miner.</p>

<p>To remove the latter objections, the English authorities
recommend the use of holes 6" or 8" in diameter,
bored with earth-augers, charged to a length of 2 or
3 calibres, and well tamped. When applicable, this
method is manifestly a great improvement upon the
other; but the auger is so liable to be stopped by
stones which a boring-bar might break or push to one
side, that it can only be applied in very favorable soil.

<span class="large">ORGANIZATION AND TACTICS OF MINES.</span></h2>

<p id="II_art76"><b>76. Organization of Mines.</b>&mdash;Underground warfare
is conducted in the dark, in bad air, with constant
danger of caving earth, suffocation by noxious gases,
destruction of men and galleries by intentional explosions
of hostile mines or accidental ones of our
own, in addition to the usual dangers and difficulties
of opening and supplying the mines under the close
fire of the enemy.</p>

<p>These considerations necessitate the rejection of all
complicated systems in the attack, and in the work
carried on by the defence during the siege.</p>

<p>Ignorance of the point to be selected for attack, and
the great expense of permanent countermines, also
require those prepared beforehand by the defence to
conform to simple and economical systems.</p>

<p>For this reason it is not necessary to give in detail
the systems proposed by the older writers. They are
described in most of the extended treatises on military
engineering.</p>

<p id="II_art77"><b>77. The Attack.</b>&mdash;The object of the attack is to
advance his galleries in the most rapid manner possible,
with the best available system of ventilation,
and to place his mines in such position as to break up
the galleries and destroy the men, materiel, and works
of the defence, both above and below ground; or to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
form connecting craters which may be occupied and
converted into parallels, trenches, etc.</p>

<p id="II_art78"><b>78.</b> To accomplish this, when no natural ravine exists,
a deep trench or “<i>lodgment</i>” is made, usually connecting
the entrances of all the galleries and serving as a
communication between them, and as a depot for such
supplies as must always be at hand.</p>

<p>From this lodgment the galleries are started by a
shaft, blinded descent, or mining-gallery; the method
depending upon the depth to be reached and the thickness
of cover required.</p>

<p>The entrance of each gallery is protected from horizontal
and vertical fire, and from splinters, by a bomb-proof
cover and traverses of sufficient thickness and
strength.</p>

<p>The galleries are generally driven in lines nearly parallel,
and at such distance apart that the hostile miners
working at any point between them will be heard, either
from the main galleries or from returns called “<i>listening-galleries</i>”
or “<i>listeners</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a></p>

<p>Depending upon the depth at which they are placed
and other circumstances arising in different cases, the
main galleries in various sieges have been placed at distances
apart varying from about 8 to 30 yards.</p>

<p>These galleries are connected at intervals by “<i>transverse
galleries</i>” or “<i>transversals</i>,” which assist the ventilation
very much and give additional communication
between them.</p>

<p>Branches for placing mines are driven in prolongation
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
of the gallery or obliquely to the right or left, and,
when the gallery is at a low level, inclining upward so
as to shorten the line of least resistance, economize
powder, and diminish the injury to the gallery and
branches, resulting from the explosion of the mine.</p>

<p id="II_art79"><b>79.</b> When the hostile miners come within striking
distance of each other, each strives to run his galleries
directly toward the other in order to avoid exposing its
flank to the hostile mine; thus diminishing as much as
possible the injury resulting from its explosion.</p>

<p id="II_art80"><b>80.</b> The mines of the attack are generally overcharged
in order to do the greatest possible injury to the mines
of the defence, and to open large craters, but undercharged
mines and camouflets are also used at times.</p>

<p id="II_art81"><b>81. The Defence.</b>&mdash;The object of the defence is to
retard or stop the advance of the attack, by the destruction
of his mines and miners, without forming craters
which will assist him in making his parallels and approaches.</p>

<p id="II_art82"><b>82.</b> For this purpose his galleries must satisfy nearly
the same conditions as those of the attack. They usually
start out from the counter-scarp gallery or from a parallel
gallery a little in advance of it, and extend to a
greater or less distance from the work, according to the
time and expense allowable for their construction. For
permanent works they are frequently prepared in time
of peace, and lined with masonry. It is particularly for
this class of countermines that many elaborate systems
have been designed for completely covering the ground,
and for throwing up the same earth several times by
mines placed at different depths and exploded in succession.
For reasons previously given, these cannot
be recommended.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span></p>

<p id="II_art83"><b>83.</b> A simple system of galleries placed as far below
the surface as practicable, parallel or slightly diverging,
connected when necessary by transversals whose lines
prolonged pass inside the enceintes, and with branches
fulfilling the same conditions driven out for listening-galleries,
will, under the direction of an energetic officer,
fulfil the conditions of defence as well, probably,
as any that can be devised.</p>

<p>The branches leading to mine-chambers can be driven
out from the main galleries, transversals, or listeners,
as may be desired; and if the hostile miners obtain
possession of any part of the system and blow it up,
the lines of craters formed will be so swept by the fire
of the work that they can hardly be occupied by the
enemy.</p>

<p id="II_art84"><b>84.</b> As a rule, the mines of the defence will be undercharged
or camouflets, to avoid the formation of exterior
craters, but the rule is not without exceptions.</p>

<p id="II_art85"><b>85. Shaft Mines</b>, mines placed in vertical shafts, are
used by both attack and defence for destroying galleries,
etc., in their vicinity. By the attack they are usually
placed in craters already formed, or in other places
protected from hostile fire. A shaft is sunk rapidly,
generally “à la Boule,” heavily “overcharged,” filled up
with earth, and fired.</p>

<p>The defence may use the same method or may sometimes
prepare them beforehand, tamping them and
leaving a tubular opening through the tamping for loading
and firing them.</p>

<h3 id="MINE_TACTICS">MINE TACTICS.</h3>

<p id="II_art86"><b>86.</b> The tactics of mine warfare result directly from
the consideration above given. The special details of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
attack and defence vary in each particular case. The
reports of mining operations in different sieges<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a> supply
precedents and give suggestions for future operations
of a like character.</p>

<p id="II_art87"><b>87. Todleben’s Rules.</b>&mdash;The general principles of
mine tactics have been laid down by General Todleben
from his experiences at Sebastopol (in Royal Engineers
Occasional Papers, vol. i., 1877). They may be summarized
as follows:</p>

<p id="II_art88"><b>88. The Attack.</b>&mdash;The besieger should advance by
several galleries, securing those on the flank by listeners.
He must be active and persistent, as the enemy
will use every available moment to develop his countermines.
When he receives the first camouflet of the
defence he must hasten to fire his overcharged mines
in the uninjured branches, in order to destroy the hostile
countermines. He will generally suffer losses more
or less heavy from this epoch forward, but must submit
to them; since too much circumspection and delay will
almost always result in complete failure.</p>

<p>Before firing the overcharged mines he must have
everything in readiness to occupy and intrench himself
in the craters formed; to open communication from
the trenches to the craters either by sap or by forming
a line of connecting craters; and for constructing shelters
for the party occupying the craters and holding
them against the sorties of the defence.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span></p>

<p>After occupying the craters, he should drive forward
his galleries from them at once, unless the besieged
has anticipated him and surrounded the craters with
branches&mdash;which may be assumed to be the case if
any delay has occurred in occupying it. In this case
he should sink shafts à la Boule, heavily overcharged,
and fire them, and immediately occupy the new crater
and push out from it; and thus progress as rapidly as
possible, by constantly placing and firing overcharged
mines, whose craters will, with little alteration, form
both communications and parallels.</p>

<p>When the fire of the defence upon the crater is so
severe that a deep shaft cannot well be sunk, a shallower
one with correspondingly small charge is first
sunk and fired, and a deeper one is sunk from the crater
thus formed.</p>

<p>The overcharged mines should be well tamped when
time permits. If not well tamped the charge should
be increased (<i>or high explosives used.</i>&mdash;J. M.).</p>

<p id="II_art89"><b>89. The Defence.</b>&mdash;The defence should push out his
galleries as far as possible and at the earliest practicable
date, connecting them by transversals for ventilation,
and holding them at a level below any likely to be
reached by the attack.</p>

<p>When near the enemy, he should stop work several
times a day and listen for sounds from the hostile miners
which will locate their position.</p>

<p>Hearing the sound of the enemy’s miner, he may
work toward him noiselessly, or prepare and charge a
chamber and await the approach of the miner toward
it, listening at the point where the hose trough (<i>tube for
fuse wires.</i>&mdash;J. M.) comes through the tamping until the
enemy is near enough to justify firing. Judgment as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
to distances must be formed from practice obtained
while driving the countermines.</p>

<p>To avoid forming craters on the surface, and to do
the greatest possible damage to the besieger’s works,
the besieged should not fire his mine until the enemy’s
distance from it is less than the line of least resistance
reckoned toward the surface.</p>

<p>When this condition is fulfilled, he may give to his
camouflet a charge of from <sup>3</sup>/<sub>10</sub> to <sup>4</sup>/<sub>10</sub> the charge for a
common mine placed at the same depth, since the
charge will produce its principal effect upon the enemy’s
gallery, and but little upon the surface.</p>

<p>Special care must be exercised by the defence to
avoid premature explosions, since a mine fired at too
great range damages only his own branch, and may
make a crater; thus working directly to the advantage
of the attack, who may prepare an overcharged mine
or sink a shaft à la Boule in the crater thus made.</p>

<p>As successive explosions of necessity damage the
branch in use, to avoid falling back, another one should
be prepared as a reserve before the first is disabled, and
at a little distance from it.</p>

<p>After the attack has fired his overcharged mine, the
defence, by a strong fire of canister, musketry, etc.,
should prevent him from occupying the craters, and if
he takes possession, should drive him out by a continuous
mortar fire, keeping him from completing his communications
by fire from guns.</p>

<p>The defence should push forward branches and establish
himself under the slope of the craters, in front and
on both flanks, and by exploding camouflets prevent
the attack from driving galleries or sinking shafts à la
Boule.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span></p>

<p>When the nature of the soil admits, many of the
camouflets will be placed by boring. Should the defensive
measures above and below ground not debar the
enemy from establishing himself in the crater, the defence
may establish overcharged mines immediately in
its front, with a view to destroying the advancing galleries
of the attack, blowing up the men and their lodgment
in the crater, and opening up the latter to the fire
of the work.</p>

<p>Shafts à la Boule being very dangerous for the countermines,
the defence should do his best to prevent
their use, by artillery and musketry fire above ground,
and by camouflets placed by boring under ground. In
addition, he must take advantage of every favorable
opportunity to delay the progress of the attack by sorties
from the works.</p>

<p id="II_art90"><b>90. Remark.</b>&mdash;In underground warfare the besieger
has a decided advantage, but the besieged, by a cool
consideration in handling his mines, and by persistently
holding back the attack, foot by foot, may very greatly
retard it, or even cause such losses and delays as to
lead to its being abandoned.</p>

<h3 id="BREACHING_BY_MINES">BREACHING BY MINES.</h3>

<p id="II_art91"><b>91.</b> The attack having reached the scarp of the work,
mines are prepared for breaching the counter-scarp and
scarp.</p>

<p>Experience shows that the charges are best located
in rear of the counterforts when they exist, or at equal
intervals along plain walls. The charge should not be
placed immediately in contact with the masonry, but in
the earth behind it, and at a depth below the top of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
the wall equal at least to 1½ the L. L. R., measured to
the face of the wall.</p>

<p>The charge should be estimated by the rules already
given, and increased by 20 to 30 per cent, so as not
only to throw down the walls, but also to break up the
earth and form a practicable breach.</p>

<p id="II_art92"><b>92.</b> The galleries for placing the chambers behind
the counterscarp are branches from the gallery of descent
into the ditch; those behind the scarp may branch
out from a gallery driven under the ditch, when water
or rock do not forbid, or from a gallery driven through
the scarp wall after crossing the ditch by sap or by a
bridge.</p>

<p id="II_art93"><b>93.</b> To start the gallery through the scarp wall, a
miner is “<i>attached</i>” to the wall by protecting him from
fire along the ditch, from sorties, and from loaded shells,
etc., rolling down upon him from the parapet by suitable
traverses and splinter-proof.</p>

<p>This operation is of course very dangerous, and is
generally impossible unless the fire of the defence
along the ditch is previously silenced. To expedite
the work of the miner a gun is sometimes brought
down through the gallery, and the face of the wall is
shattered by its fire before the miner is “<b>attached</b>.”

<span class="large">BLASTING AND DEMOLITIONS.</span></h2>

<h3 id="BLASTING">BLASTING.</h3>

<p id="II_art94"><b>94. Blasts</b> are small mines used generally for breaking
up rocks, or masonry in demolitions.</p>

<p id="II_art95"><b>95.</b> Holes for placing the charges are drilled usually
with <i>drill-bars</i> or <i>churn-drills</i>, known also as <i>jumpers</i>.</p>

<p>These are steel bars sharpened to a chisel edge.
The <i>drill-bar</i> is usually held by one man and struck
with a hammer by another; it is turned slightly after
each blow in order to make a round hole.</p>

<p>For small holes the driller holds the drill in one hand
and strikes with the other.</p>

<p>The <i>churn-drill</i> is a longer bar, generally sharpened
at both ends and enlarged in the middle. It is used for
drilling vertical holes by raising and dropping it in the
holes, turning it slightly after each blow.</p>

<p id="II_art96"><b>96.</b> The <i>charge</i> may be gunpowder or high explosive.
If the former, it must be thoroughly tamped. If the
latter, tamping will greatly increase its effect; but it
is in some cases preferable to obtain the desired effect
by increasing the charge and saving the time taken in
tamping.</p>

<p id="II_art97"><b>97.</b> Blasts are fired by electric fuses, Bickford fuse,
firing-tubes, needles, etc.</p>

<p>The fuses have been already described.</p>

<p>The <i>firing-tube</i> is a very small iron pipe, which is inserted
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
in the powder charge and the tamping rammed
around it.</p>

<p>After the tamping is finished the tube may be filled
with fine powder poured in it if the hole is vertical or
inclined downward, or straws filled with powder may
be inserted if it inclines upward or is horizontal. A
“squib” of wet powder is also sometimes placed in the
tube and ignited, when it passes down the tube like a
rocket and fires the charge.</p>

<p>The <i>needle</i> is a smooth copper wire, longer than the
depth of the hole. It has a ring handle, by which it
may be turned around and withdrawn. It is inserted
in the charge, the tamping is well rammed around it,
and it is withdrawn, leaving a pipe in the tamping,
through which fire may be communicated, as described
for the firing-tube.</p>

<p id="II_art98"><b>98. Tamping.</b>&mdash;The best and safest tamping is
perfectly dry silicious sand, poured in the hole so as to
fill it completely, but not rammed. It cannot be used
in holes which incline upward nor when the needle is
used.</p>

<p>In such cases moist clay, brick-dust, etc., are used.
The first layers are pressed in upon the charge, and the
subsequent ones thoroughly rammed down with a copper
tamping-bar. A hammer is used with the bar,
when necessary, in deep holes and hard rock.</p>

<p><i>With high explosives no tamping should be used except
dry sand or water. Holes which incline upwards should
receive an extra charge and be untamped.</i></p>

<p id="II_art99"><b>99. Determining the Charge.</b>&mdash;The charge of gunpowder
or high explosive required for any particular
hole in ordinary blasting can be best estimated by
an experienced blaster. If one is not to be obtained,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
an approximate estimate for the first experiment may
be made from the formulas (counting the high explosives
about four or five times as strong as gunpowder
for ordinary use), and the charges for subsequent blasts
may be estimated from the effects of those first fired.</p>

<p id="II_art100"><b>100. Precautions.</b>&mdash;If a <i>tamped</i> hole misses fire <i>it
should never be cleared out for recharging</i>. A new hole
should be drilled near, but not breaking into it.</p>

<p>Electric fuses or Bickford fuses (with blasting-caps
for high explosives) should always be used when they
can be obtained.</p>

<h3 id="DEMOLITIONS">DEMOLITIONS.</h3>

<p id="II_art101"><b>101. Deliberate Demolitions</b>, such as the destruction
of walls, casemates, etc., in time of peace, or at a distance
from the enemy in time of war, should be so
made as to economize powder and work. To accomplish
this, the mines and blasts should be located where
they will produce the best effects attainable, and the
charges should be proportioned to the work required
from them.</p>

<p>The table previously given (p. 124) will serve as a
guide for computing the first charges used, and from
the results of these the charges of subsequent ones may
be determined.</p>

<p>Judgment must be used in placing the charges, so
that, when possible, they will destroy the supports and
allow the superstructure to break up by falling.</p>

<p>The charges will usually be placed in chambers under
or hollowed out in the masonry. Sometimes they
are more advantageously placed in a trench outside and
close to the foot of the walls. They should always be
well tamped: when in mine-chambers, by methods previously
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
described; when in trenches, or laid along the
exterior of walls, by loading them with earth, etc., until
the line of least resistance passes through the wall to
be destroyed.</p>

<p id="II_art102"><b>102. Hasty Demolitions</b> are made when the time
available for the work is limited.</p>

<p>The structures usually destroyed are houses, walls,
stockades, bridges, tunnels, canal-locks, railroads, rolling-stock,
etc., etc.</p>

<p>The time does not usually allow the charge to be
placed in the most advantageous position or to be
properly tamped. For this reason the high explosives
are best suited for this kind of work, and large charges
are a necessity.</p>

<p id="II_art103"><b>103. Houses and Magazines</b> are best destroyed by
placing several charges with connecting trains inside
and along the walls, laying strong timbers upon them,
with struts from the timbers to the floors and roof
above; barricading the doors and windows from within,
and firing the powder from a safe distance without.</p>

<p id="II_art104"><b>104. Walls.</b>&mdash;A wall not exceeding 3 or 4 feet in
thickness may be breached by charges of gunpowder
placed at intervals along it. Calling the thickness of
the wall in feet <i>t</i>, the charge in pounds may be 3<i>t<sup>3</sup></i>,
placed at intervals of 2<i>t</i>.</p>

<p>For gun-cotton the Woolwich rule calls for charges
in pounds of from ⅓<i>t<sup>2</sup></i> to ½<i>t<sup>2</sup></i> per running foot. Experiments
made in New York with dynamite indicate
that the charges should be at least ½<i>t<sup>2</sup></i> per running
foot, and for very good masonry should exceed
this.</p>

<p>A charge of dynamite of ½<i>t<sup>2</sup></i> per running foot will
be given by a cylindrical cartridge whose diameter in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
inches equals the thickness of the wall in feet.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a> The
effect of the charge will be very much increased by
throwing over it even a very light tamping of earth or
sand.</p>

<p id="II_art105"><b>105. Stockades.</b>&mdash;A strong stockade or palisade
may be broken down by charges of from 40 to 60 lbs.
of gunpowder placed in contact with it, and preferably
covered with sand-bags. 10 or 15 lbs. of high explosive
should produce about the same effect.</p>

<p id="II_art106"><b>106. Bridges.</b>&mdash;Arched bridges are best attacked in
the piers if high and thin, or at the haunches and crown
of the arch. Two or more charges in the length of the
pier, or width of the roadway, will be more effective
than the same amount in a single charge at the middle.</p>

<p>The charges should be placed in chambers cut in the
piers or down through the roadway to the back of the
arch.</p>

<p>The abutments of single-span arches are generally
very strong, and the haunches well covered with earth
and masonry. In hurried work, therefore, the crown
will generally be selected, a trench dug down to it
across the roadway, the charge placed in the trench,
tamped if possible, and fired.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a></p>

<p>High explosives, from their shattering effect, are
perhaps most advantageously used by suspending them
beneath and in contact with the arch at the crown and
haunches. The plank or timber upon which they are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
placed should be as heavy as possible, in order to act
as a partial tamping, and should be drawn up so that
the explosive will be in actual contact with the soffit of
the arch.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances they should produce as
great an effect as four or five times their weight of gunpowder.</p>

<p>Iron and wooden truss-bridges should be thrown
down by breaking the main braces near the piers, or
the chords near the centre, by charges placed in a joint
if possible. High explosives are particularly valuable
for this purpose.</p>

<p>In wooden bridges they may be placed in auger-holes
bored for them, and in iron bridges inside the hollow
members, between eye-bars, or in other similar places.</p>

<p id="II_art107"><b>107. Tunnels, Canal-locks</b>, and similar constructions
must be attacked with large charges, so placed as
to temporarily or permanently disable the work, as may
be considered necessary. The location of each charge
should be determined and its amount computed from
these considerations before the destruction is attempted.</p>

<p>A temporary obstruction is frequently all that is
necessary or desirable for these works, and the damage
done to them should be carefully regulated with a
view to their subsequent repair and use.</p>

<p id="II_art108"><b>108. Railroads.</b>&mdash;Railroads are temporarily disabled
by tearing up the track, making hot fires of piles of
ties, placing the rails upon them so that they will heat
and bend by their own weight; or, better still, twisting
the rails while hot by suitably-shaped steel hooks and
wooden levers of the kind devised by General Haupt
(<a href="#pl_12">Pl. XII</a>, Fig. 33). Rails so twisted cannot be again
used until re-rolled.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span></p>

<p id="II_art109"><b>109. Rolling-stock.</b>&mdash;Railroad cars may be disabled
by breaking one or more wheels with sledges, or may
be destroyed by burning. Locomotives may be disabled
temporarily by carrying away the smaller parts
of the mechanism, or permanently by breaking the
engine-cylinders with sledges; bursting the boilers or
burning out their fire-boxes by drawing out nearly all
their water, fastening down the safety-valves, and
building a hot fire in the furnaces; or by making a hot
fire under them so as to heat and thus bend or warp
the reciprocating parts of the machinery.</p>

<p id="II_art110"><b>110.</b> In all hasty demolitions with explosives the
charges should be well in excess of those computed by
the ordinary rules: first, because the explosives will
not be so placed as to act to the greatest advantage;
and, second, because the demolition should be <i>immediate</i>
and <i>complete</i>.

In the siege of Strasburg, 1870, a bridge of beer casks was built
across the ditch of Lunette No. 52, between nightfall and 10 <small>P. M.</small>,
September 21st. The ditch was about 66 feet wide and 9 to 10 feet deep.
This bridge gave access to the lunette. It was subsequently sunk by
the fire of the work and was replaced by a causeway.&mdash;Franco-German
War, Official Account, Part 2, vol. 1., pp. 88, 89.</p></div>

Willet’s Point in 1877-83 it would seem that the quantities given in
this table are greater than those required if good American powder is
used. These mines, in a soil of modified drift,
used. These mines, in a soil of modified drift,<br />
with a L. L. R. of 12 ft. required 1.02 lbs. per cu. yd. = 1 lb. ⅓ oz.; and<br />
with a L. L. R. of 17 ft. required 1.15 lbs. per cu. yd. = 1 lb. 2½ oz.<br />

Six-lined craters (<i>r</i> = 3<i>l</i>) are generally considered as the practical
limit of overcharged mines, although at Chatham mines have been
fired giving <i>r</i> = (3¾)<i>l</i>. The published data concerning them indicate
that they required charges larger than the formulas above given call
for.</p></div>

General Abbot’s experiments in submarine mining fix the relative
values of cannon powder and dynamite No. 1 in water, measured by
the pressure exerted by them (not by the craters formed), as 1 : 2.45.
The characters of the media and the explosives would naturally lead
to the inference that the superiority of dynamite over powder would
be greater in water than in earth.&mdash;J. M.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_12" href="#FNanchor_12" class="label">12</a>
The 82 lb. dynamite-mine at Willet’s Point produced almost
exactly the same effect upon the gallery of access as the 200-lb.
cannon-powder mine, while its external crater was considerably less
in diameter. Its crater was surrounded, however, by concentric
cracks spaced at intervals of 3 or 4 feet to a distance of about 40 feet
from the centre of the crater. No such effect was produced by the
powder-mine.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the actual radii of rupture produced by five
experimental mines fired at Olmutz in 1871-2 agree very closely with
the values which result from applying Lebrun’s formulas to craters of
the same size and shape produced by gunpowder, and indicate that
charges of dynamite and gunpowder which produce identical craters
will also have identical radii of rupture. The somewhat contradictory
results given by the Willet’s Point and Olmutz mines show the
necessity for further experiments.</p></div>

In the blasting at Hell Gate, 1870-76, several cases occurred, both
with nitro-glycerine and compressed gun-cotton, in which a part of the
charge exploded, breaking the blast-hole nearly to the bottom, and
leaving the remainder of the charge unexploded in the bottom of the
hole, from which it was subsequently recovered. Similar results were
obtained in experiments, conducted by Capt. (now Major) Heuer,
1875-6, with long tubes filled with nitro-glycerine. See also Encyc.

provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
